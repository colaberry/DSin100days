There are various pieces that we need to cover in this specific example. The first part of the code is fairly straight forward. We pass 'x' and 'y' to 'ColumnDataSource' which let us create the data object source. We plot the line plot using 'x' and 'y' as strings and 'source' as the data source in 'plot.line'.

This is a bit of a double edged sword since, since callbacks and extra code is optimized for bokeh it is definitely faster than using Ipython widgets. JavaScript can introduce an added level of difficulties and debugging may not be that easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) On the other hand Ipthyon widgets provide a python and jupyter friendly way of building interactive plots. However as we mentioned since the widgets are external to bokeh, they will have to replot a figure every time. This can slow down your visualization considerably, especially when you have large dataset, even dataset with hundreds of MBs will struggle with this approach. Another place this will fail is when you are plotting streaming data, then plotting data will not work well with Ipython widgets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use what? \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this section and course, you have come across multiple ways that you can plot data. You have seen examples of - \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Matplotlib <br>\n",
    "2) Plotly <br>\n",
    "3) Bokeh <br> \n",
    "4) Other sources <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "It can become confusing as to which package to use when. This is where some of the guidelines below come in handy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Matplotlib</b> <br><br> Use matplotlib for quick and dirty results. There are going to be times when you need results on the fly, you do not need  advanced interactivity but a simple visualization. Combining matplotlib with %matplotlib notebook after import statements allows for simple interactive matplotlib figure (but only in jupyter notebook). So make sure that you have that in place for creating easy interactive plots in jupyter notebook. You can also use Ipython widgets with matplotlib plots which is useful. Matplotlib does have a lot of options which are useful. You can easily export matplotlib files into various formats and create animation with matplotlib as well. Not to mention that since matplotlib is older, there is good documentation on its features and there is a lot of help available online for beginners. <br><br>  There are some drawbacks to matplotlib. The quality of your exported plot may not be too good. The interactivity of matplotlib is limited. For presentations and talks matplotlib plots just don't look good. There is some 3d plot support as well in matplotlib but it has its limitation. Another drawback is that to add plotly and bokeh type features it requires a lot of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Plotly</b> <br><br> Plotly is by far the easiest library to work with for visualizations. Each Plotly plot comes with basic elements of interactivity- the ability to hover over data points, the ability to change hover tooltip values, an easy way to implement interactive legends etc. This means the amount of code we have to write in order to have an interactive and useful plotly plot is minimal. It also has many different plotly types available. It has its own library for widgets similar to bokeh and it covers a broad range of use cases. <br><br> Plotly has two ways you can plot plots quickly. One way is to use [plotly express](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/). Plotly express is fairly new and allows you to design plots in a single line of code.It comes with a lot of guard rails so you can focus on working with your data rather than configuring your plot. There is also a third party library for plotly called [Cufflinks](https://plot.ly/python/v3/ipython-notebooks/cufflinks/) which acts like plolty express. <br><br> Another big advantage of plotly is plotly-dash. Plotly dash is a framework to create visualization applications that can be deployed on a website, you can use plotly  widgets with plotly dash. Bokeh as a similar system called bokeh server. Plotly Dash is primarily used to build deployable dashboards for monitoring processes but it can be used to host almost any type of plotly interactive visualizations. <br><br> While plotly is extremely powerful, it has its drawbacks. Plotly can be slow with large datasets. There are certain aspects of plot customization that are not easy to implement in plotly. It is generally advisable to use plotly express or cufflinks rather than vanilla plotly for quick plots but learning vanilla plotly is crucial especially when you want to build plotly dash applications. The sytax for plotly plots frustratingly does not always carry over to plotly dash. The documentation can be unclear with certain types of plots. Most of plotly features we have described are based on plotly offline. Plotly also has an online version where you can store charts and even get organization support for Plotly dash, however this is extremely expensive. \n",

    "- <b>Bokeh</b> <br><br> As discussed in the beginning of this section, an alternate to plotly is bokeh. Both plotly and bokeh share many similar features however there is more customization in bokeh compared to plolty. One really nice feature in bokeh is that you can specify which interactivity tools you want on the plot. Bokeh also has certain features like patches that plotly does not have. For example, with patches you can draw any type of shapes easily. We use this feature especially in the math and stat section where we talk about the area under the curve. There are other annotation features and plotting features that bokeh has that plotly does not carry. A major advantage that bokeh has over plotly is that it can handle large datasets. It also integrates well with holoviews which is also good at handling large datasets.<br><br> Similar to plotly dash, bokeh can also be used to build and serve applications. It has similar features to plotly dash and can be used to build dashboards and stand alone interactive visualizations. Bokeh's dashboarding framework and bokeh in general is very well documented hence if you are willing to go through the documentation you can pretty much learn bokeh fairly quickly. <br><br> One of the main drawbacks of bokeh is that unlike plotly, it does not support anything like plotly express. You can use a third party tool like holoviews which support bokeh extensively but within bokeh there is nothing that will help you plot bokeh plots quickly. There are certain types of plots where this can be a huge problem. Take for example, the heatmap plot. Plotly has a clean way to provide data to a function that will plot a heatmap and you can customize parts of the plot. Plotting heatmaps in bokeh can be extremely frustration since you need to construct the plot element by element. This allows for more control on the plots but it can also be challenging when you are trying to get a plot up and running quickly. Another issue is that to add callbacks and more interactivities to plots you will have to use JavaScript. While there are good documented examples of how to use JavaScript in bokeh callbacks, it can be a bit jarring to go to JavaScript which is working on a python application. \n",

    "- <b>Other alternatives</b> <br><br> Apart from the three big visualization packages that we have covered so far there are others that are available for python. We have already seen some examples of [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Seaborn is heavily used with matplotlib and pandas. It comes in handy in generating good looking plots. [Holoviews](http://holoviews.org/) is another package that specializes simple plotting syntax and easy to understand code for plotting. Another plotting library that is being currently developed for jupyter notebooks is [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot). \n",

    "Ultimately, there are many libraries and tools that you can use to visualize data. The important point is to keep in mind the purpose of the visualization. Adding interactivity or buttons to a plot when it's not needed distracts from the core purpose of the visualization which is to communicate data in a visual manner for easy inference. As you design multiple data visualizations keep in mind that the visualizations should be able to tell the story of the data. Check out our micro-course on data stories for an example of it! \n",
