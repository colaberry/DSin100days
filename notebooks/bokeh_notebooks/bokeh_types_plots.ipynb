    "The main difference between plotting a scatter plot or a line plot or a bar plot comes in the next line where we generate a figure of type 'vbar' which stands for vertical bar.

The argument bottom tells us what is the starting values for the bar. Currently its set to 0. Suppose we wanted to plot the bar from 10 to 50 units, we can do that by specifying the argument 'bottom' as 10 and 'top' as 50. If we want to specific different values for each bar, then we need to specify an array of values. Remember count list here is- [50, 50, 50] We can also specific the width of each bin.\n",

    "the plot would look like-\n",
    "\n",
    "![hiris](images/hiris.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "there are a few differences in the code compared to the code of the vertical bar plot. First being, rather than 'x_range' we have 'y_range' this is because we if we are plotting horizontal plots our labels will be on the y-axis. In other words, the axis where we are going to place our categories is the y-axis. The rest of 'figure' definition does not change. The method to add a horizontal bar is 'hbar', similar to 'vbhar' it takes an axis argument 'y' this argument should contain the names of the categories that we want to plot. We have the argument 'height' which controls the thickness of the horizontal bars, this is the same as the argument 'width' for vertical bars, I have plotting this as a list to show that you can control the height of each bar. Similarly, you can also do 'width = [1, 0.2, 0.6]' this would mean that we plot vertical bars of different thicknesses. Like vertical bar, we can specific location of the bar, in this case,  as 'left' and 'right'. So, if we wanted to specify a horizontal bar from 10 to 30 we would write- 'right=30' and 'left=10'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we specific the bars in bokeh allows for a great degree of control. Further more, we are carrying over many of the figure properties that we learned from the first bokeh notebook. \n",

    "## 2) Adding legends to plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the type of chart we want to be able to add legends to a chart to show what are the fields of data that we are looking at. We held of doing this from earlier since its easier to illustrate with bar charts, suppose you have a vertical bar chart of the iris dataset. From the above example you would realize that all three of the categories have the same color. So how can we represented them differently, we can do the following\n",

    "show(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will notice a plot with three bars with colors red, green and blue. Now we want to add a legend to this so that we can easily see which category does each color belong to. Ofcourse you can read it off the x-axis but if you add the legend, you wont need to the x axis labels. So you would add the legend by adding- \n",

    "\n",

In our case the first point of the patch must be (0,0) hence we have copied the 'y_value' into a new variable 'shade_y' where we set the first y value to be 0.
