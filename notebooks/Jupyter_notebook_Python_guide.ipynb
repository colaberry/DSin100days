    "# Jupyter notebooks and Python Guide: Best Practices\n",
    "## How to write python code for projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic guidelines to writing python code in jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Python 3, there is really no reason to use 2 in this day and age.\n",
    "- Try to keep variable names short, for example: this_is_a_bad_variable_name, good_vname. \n",
    "- Try to use underscores in writing variable names. Its more readable. \n",
    "- Add comments to your code generously, the more you comment, the more helpful it is for the reader. That reader includes you as well, suppose you come back after 6 months, you will most likely not remember what the code does, in such cases having the comments is very useful. Typically you should be writing more comments than code. \n",
    "- When using a jupyter notebook do not write 50 lines of code in each cell. Breakdown the code into related chunks and add them to a separate cell. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    unclean_df = \"an unclean data frame\"\n",
    "    clean_df = \"an intermediate cleaning step\"\n",
    "    clean_df2 = \"applied cleaning operation on clean_df\"\n",
    "    plt.figure()\n",
    "    plt.plot(clean_df2['column1'], clean_df2['column2']) \n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    you can perform the cleaning operation in the first cell and the plotting operation in the second cell. You dont need to perform everything in the first cell. \n",
    "- The only exception for this rule is if you reuse a varible name it can cause errors if you do so in a seperate cell. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    # CELL 1 \n",
    "    unclean_df = pd.read_csv(\"data source\")\n",
    "    unclean_df = \"an unclean data frame\"\n",
    "    clean_df = \"applied cleaning operation on unclean_df\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # CELL 2 \n",
    "    clean_df  = clean_df[\"subset\"] # Suppose you take a subset of the data\n",
    "    plt.figure()\n",
    "    plt.plot(clean_df['column1'], clean_df['column2']) \n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    In the above example, we will run into a problem since ```python clean_df``` has been modified in the second cell and overwritten. The value of the dataframe would depend on which cell you are runnning. In order to avoid such things, its a good idea to either use unique variable names each time, or if you have to reuse variable names then do so in the same cell as where the variable name was first declared/initiated. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Its good practice to package of code into functions, this way you can ensure that you are isolating steps. Its much harder to troubleshoot a large chuck of code rather than a set of functions.\n",
    "- When you write functions, make sure you include a docstring and please use the Numpy/Scipy docstring format. This is one of the most readable docstring formats out there. \n"
