    "Let's start with a histogram shown below. For instance, we measured 100 people's heights (between 5 and 7 feet) and plot a histogram for their heights. Because the values of heights are continuous, we define several intervals to make our histogram easy to read. The first bin is `[5.00, 5.25)` (including 5.00, but excluding 5.25.) and the second `[5.25, 5.50)`, etc.. Only the last bin `[6.75, 7.00]` includes 7.00. Here, `[` and `)` are math notations that define intervals. `[` or `]` means including, but `(` or `)` means excluding. If we want to know the probability of a person's height falling into `[5.75, 6.00)`, we can use the number of people in that bin, which is 11, divided by total number 100. It gives us the probability of 11%.\n"

    "A <b>Random experiment</b> is any real world event such as a roll of a dice, a game of soccer or any event that brings random results.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the game of soccer, there could be a number of goals scored by either of the teams. The number of goals scored by a given team is a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we can define a random variable as, a real-valued variable whose value is determined by an underlying random experiment. In other words, it is a quantitative representation of the outcomes of an event, which is the set/subset of all possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an experiment and set of possible outcomes, random variable associates a particular number to each outcome. Consider an event where a coin is tossed twice. We can define a sample space as<br> S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}<br>\n",
    "This sample space includes all possible events, HH is a single event among them. The random variable where number of Heads occur is denoted as:\n",
    "$$ X \\to \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$ \n",

    "## Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability density function (PDF) is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution for a continuous random variable. Since continuous random variables can take any value such as 75.55 for temperature of a given city it is generally represented as a density. Due to this the Probability Density Function represents the area under the curve usually between an  interval in which the variable will fall. The total area in this interval of the graph equals the probability of a continuous random variable occurring.\n",

In a rush to dress up, she opens her briefcase and picks out two pieces of clothing at random. Given that her first pick is a skirt, what is the probability that she is in luck and picks a shirt to go with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical example of conditional probability, which is the probability of a second event happening given that a first event has already occured. This particular case of conditional probability deals with dependent events. Elizabeth has to pull out a second piece of clothing that matches her first pick. Elizabeth having a matching pair of clothing is dependent on her first and second pick.\n",

Our final answer is a combination of the first and second pick, thus giving us our final answer = 4/17 X 8/16\n",

    "## Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory, conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occured.

But if we know that there is a storm the same day, then the probability of rain will be much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of conditional probability is one of the most fundamental concepts in probability theory. While it may seem very trivial, conditional probabilities can be quite confusing and require careful attention.<br>\n",
