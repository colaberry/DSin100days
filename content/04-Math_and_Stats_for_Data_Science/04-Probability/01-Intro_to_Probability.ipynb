    "Let's start with a histogram shown below. For instance, we measured 100 people's heights (between 5 and 7 feet) and plot a histogram for their heights. Because the values of heights are continuous, we define several intervals to make our histogram easy to read. The first bin is `[5.00, 5.25)` (including 5.00, but excluding 5.25) and the second `[5.25, 5.50)`, etc.. Only the last bin `[6.75, 7.00]` includes 7.00. If we want to know the probability of a person's height falling into `[5.75, 6.00)`, we can use the number of people in that bin, which is 11, divided by total number 100. It gives us the probability of 11%.\n"
