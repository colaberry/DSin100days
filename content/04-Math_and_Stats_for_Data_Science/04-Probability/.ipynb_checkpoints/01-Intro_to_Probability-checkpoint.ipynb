    "## Introduction to Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities arise in many problems dealing with random events where an outcome is not known or cannot be predicted reasonably confidently. \n",
    "\n",
    "An event is called random if it is practically impossible to predict from the initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example , the toss of a coin could yield an outcome of a H or T. Similarly the outcome of a roll of a dice would yield a value in the set : {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "The value of a probability is a number between 0 and 1 inclusive. An event that cannot occur has a probability (of happening) equal to 0 and the probability of an event that is certain to occur has a probability equal to 1.(see probability scale below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1 of this probability course we will introduce you to some of the basics of Probability. The topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are Random Variables (Discrete and Continuous Random Variables)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Probability mass functions, \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Probability density function\n",

    "## 1.0 Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we define what are Random Variables, we must see what are random experiments and events. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>Random experiment</b> is any real world event such as a roll of a dice, a game of soccer or any event that brings random results.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to wikipedia, <b>an event</b> within probability theory is a set of outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the game of soccer, there could be a number of goals scored by either of the teams. The number of goals scored by a given team is a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we can define a random variable as, a real-valued variable whose value is determined by an underlying random experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an experiment and set of possible outcomes, random variable associates a particular number to each outcome. Consider an event where a coin is tossed twice. The random variable where number of Heads occur is denoted as:\n",
    "$$ X \\to \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$ \n",
    "Random variables can be either continuous or discrete. A random variable is discrete if its range is finite or at most countably infinite. A random variable is continuous if it can take uncountably infinite number of values.\n",

    "## Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability density function (PDF) is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution for a continuous random variable. Since continuous random variables can take any value such as 75.55 for temperature of a given city it is generally represented as a density. Due to this the Probability Density Function represents the area under the curve usually between an  interval in which the variable will fall. The total area in this interval of the graph equals the probability of a continuous random variable occurring.\n",

    "## Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "For her vacation in Hawaii, Elizabeth has packed 5 pants, 4 skirts and 8 shirts. On her first day venturing out to explore the islands, Elizabeth is running late. In a rush to dress up, she opens her briefcase and picks out two pieces of clothing at random. Given that her first pick is a skirt, what is the probability that she is in luck and picks a shirt to go with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical example of conditional probability, which is the probability of a second event happening given that a first event has already occured. This particular case of conditional probability deals with dependent events. Elizabeth has to pull out a second piece of clothing that matches her first pick. Elizabeth having a matching pair of clothing is dependent on her first and second pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "As most of you might have already guessed, the probability is: $$P(MatchingPair) = \\frac{4}{17} * \\frac{8}{16}$$ <br>\n",
    "(Hint): She first picks a skirt with probability 4/17, which leaves her with 3 remaining skirts, 5 pants and 8 shirts. Out of the 16 remaining clothes, her only favourable picks are the 8 shirts, thus giving us 8/16. Our final answer is a combination of the first and second pick, thus giving us our final answer = 4/17 X 8/16\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory, conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occured. Denoted as <strong>P(B|A)</strong>, is the probabilty of event B given event A has already occured.To put this into persepective, let us assume that the probability of rain on any random day is 10%. But if we know that there is a storm the same day, then the probability of rain will be much higher.\n",
