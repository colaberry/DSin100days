    "# Lab - Regression Metrics\n",
    "Suppose we have the following data:<br>\n",
    "x = ([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14])<br>\n",
    "y = ([45.6, 52.3, 64.9, 58.4, 81.2, 75.7, 89.5, 92.3, 101.2, 60.5])\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Please fit a linear regression model, using y as the target variable. <br>(Hint: use scikit-learn library's linear_model, refer to the notebook \"Regression_metrics\").<br> Assign the intercept and coefficient of the model to variable a and b, respectively. Calculate the MSE, RMSE, MAE and R-squared for this model, and assign them to variable MSE, RMSE, MAE and r_squared, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) There is another model: $y = 15 + 6.5*x$ , please calculate MSE, RMSE, MAE and R-squared. Assign them to variable MSE_1, RMSE_1, MAE_1 and r_squared_1, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Compare these two models' RMSE and MAE. Which one has the lower RMSE? Which one has the lower MAE? If we consider the last value of y as a true outlier, which model would you pick, why? <br>(Hint: You can use bokeh to draw the regression line and compare, refer to the notebook \"Regression_metrics\")."
