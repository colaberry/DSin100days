    "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. You will often use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead."
