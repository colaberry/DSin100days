    "# Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now begin our journey towards machine learning. Before we start off on the journey, it is good to clear our thought process about a few key concepts such as Data Science vs Machine Learning and Data Scientist vs Machine Learning Engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Science vs Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So why are we learning about Machine Learning in a Data Science program? In order to answer this question and gain a clearer understanding of the concepts that you are studying, we need to look into what each of the above terms mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Machine Learning:</b> One of the widely used definitions of Machine Learning is given by Arthur Samuel in 1959 - \"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\". It can be treated as the ecosystem of mathematical and/or statistical models that learn patterns from data and have the ability to extend and apply these patterns to previously unseen conditions, to predict what the outcome may be.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Data Science:</b> It is the appropriate application of various Machine Learning models to recognize better and meaningful patterns in data. The 'Science' part of Data Science is that, it is a methodical experimentation on the data, i.e. various models are applied to the data and they are optimized/tuned, in order to improve the quality of insights drawn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this definition, we now understand that what we are learning are Machine Learning models and what we do with data using these models is Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now an important thing we need to understand here is that the two different roles in industry - Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer differ from each other in a manner that is not similar to the difference between Data Science and Machine Learning itself. Let us look at individual definitions of Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to understand more.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Data Scientist:</b> A Data Scientist is someone who performs Data Science, i.e., experiments with various models on a given data set in order to better recognize and predict patterns in data. The Data Scientist is also responsible for interpreting model results and explaining the insights to business decision makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Machine Learning Engineer:</b> A Machine Learning Engineer is someone who is responsible for deploying the model built by the Data Scientist onto a stable production environment and maintaining it. These duties may include - \n",
    "* ensuring the model scales for any amount of data\n",
    "* ensure models runs periodically and provides output reliably\n",
    "* ensure model parameters are optimized and tuned for efficiency\n",
    "* ensure model doesn't break due to changes in features\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, Data Scientist applies Machine Learning model and a Machine Learning Engineer optimizes, deploys and maintains the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of ML approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main types of machine learning approaches:\n",
    "* Supervised Learning: Learning models on labeled data\n",
    "* Unsupervised Learning: Learning models on unlabled data\n",
    "* Reinforcement Learning: Learning based on feedback for actions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will learn about Supervised and Unsupervised Learning approaches in detail and get introduced to Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does Supervised Learning mean in Data Science ?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As Data Scientists you will be faced with obstacles regarding data handling and processing since there will datasets that won't adhere to the traditional format of collecting data. And we will explore those kinds of datasets in this section try to run statistical analysis on them.<br>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "In this section, of the course, we will be learning about creating statistical models from different types of data. Lets begin by deciphering the name of this section <strong>\"Supervised Learning\"</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Learning</b></li>\n",
    "    <small>It is the concept of learning new or existing patterns in a dataset, where datapoints are labeled. Labeled data means data which is tagged in order to convey metadata about the specific data point which can help us understand origin, meaning, affiliation and associated properties of the data point.<br>\n",
    "    </small>\n",
    "    <li><b>Supervised</b></li>\n",
    "    <small>It simply refers to the idea of using data that contains exmaples or ,in practical sence, labels for the learning to happen.<br>\n",
    "    </small>\n",
    "    <p></p>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
