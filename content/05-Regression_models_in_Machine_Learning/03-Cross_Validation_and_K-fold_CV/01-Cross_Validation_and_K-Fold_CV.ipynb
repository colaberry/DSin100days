    "#### What is Cross Validation ?\n",
    "Cross Validation is a practice of <strong>tuning</strong> your <strong>predictive model</strong> to prevent the models from <strong>overfitting</strong> or <strong>underfitting</strong> a dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive deeper as to what the definitions mean and we will begin with the term predictive model.\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Predictive Model</li>\n",
    "    <large>It refers to an algorithm which discovers new patterns in a dataset.</large>\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    <li>Tuning</li>\n",
    "    <large>The concept of making your Model make better predictions. </large>\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    <li>Overfitting</li>\n",
    "    <large>The idea that your algorithm/model becomes too familiar with only a certaian set of training data. Making the model a failure with other types of datasets.</large>\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    <li>Underfit</li>\n",
    "    <large>The idea that only your model isn't good enough and needs more tuning</large>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice of Cross-validation begins by splitting conditioned dataset for train-test dataset. This is a traditional practice followed in a professional environment.<br>\n",
    "We can split the dataset either:- \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>80/20 where 80% are training dataset and rest 20% are the test dataset</li>\n",
    "    <li>70/30 where 70% are training dataset and rest 30% are the test dataset</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above 2 scenarios are mostly used in cross validation. <br>\n",
    "But we have the freedom to experiment with different type so of combinations, it advised not to take 50/50 because it leaves the model unfinished or an underfitting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross Validation helps with understanding how your model might perform with new datasets. <br>\n"
