    "# Introduction to Statsmodels (Python) & Sklearn\n",
    "In the section we intend to get exposed to the advanced tools for analysing data. Statsmodel is a Python module and Sklearn a Library.\n",
    "Lets begin by defining a Python module and Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module: It is a collection of classes and its methods as well as functions. This can be just a simple function and can be imported by many scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Library: it is a collection of Modules which helpes using advanced and predefined functions for calculations and manupulation of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only explored different ways to manipulate data with the help of objects such as Numpy arrays and lists as well as pandas Dataframes. These objects allow a Data scientist to input and output data and reshape data for the benefit of the classifier/regressor. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is a classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "And how is the data put in a sequence which can be available for further analysis ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier is described as a model predictor. \n",
    "Assume a Data Scientist collects data and wants to find patterns/trends in it, he/she would have create a model on that dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "A model in this case means to observe a value's (dependent variable) behaviour based on other variables' (independent variable) distincet values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statsmodels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction and Explanation\n",
    "This module helps with analyzing data and creating statistical models.  \n",
    "In order to understand how to utilise this Module, we also need to have knowledge regarding statistics which we will learn in the sections ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier here would mainly cover Descriptive Statistics ( we will see an example for this). \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression: Observing how a certain variable reacts or behaves when an another variable is changed. In the \n",
    "simplest scenarios we chose to observe the behaviour of Y when X is changed on 2D Plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formula of a line: y = mx + b\n",
    "                   \n",
    "                   m = slope \n",

    "## Sklearn\n",
    "This Library concerns itself with data mining and analysing tools for the purposes of classifying, clustering and preprocessing. It is mainly used for the machine learning aspect of Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier here would help the its user to predict the behaviour based on the tested data or values\n",
