    "## 1. Generating array with random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy library has a sub-module called 'random', which is used to generate random numbers for a given distribution. It is especially useful for randomly sampling data for specific experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions - rand() and randint() can be studied. These functions are most common and intuitive in terms of usage.\n",
    "* **rand()** function takes an integer as an argument and generates a given number of random values between 0 and 1. The values generated by this function are floating point values.\n",
    "* **randint()** function takes 3 parameters - lower limit, upper limit and number of values to be generated. As the name suggests, it generates a given number of random integers in a specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.random.rand(5)\n",
    ">>> array([ 0.93371582,  0.82386466,  0.34771991,  0.59338646,  0.41190981])\n",

    "Permutation is done when we need to select set of numbers from a list and form an order. For example: If in a class, we want to select first three ranks from a group of 100 students. Fo when we find the first rank student(A) , we leave out that person A as he was already selected and do permutation on the remaining 99 students. and once 2nd rank student is found. these two student's names are left out and permutation is done on the remaining. So in permutation order plays a major role.\n",
