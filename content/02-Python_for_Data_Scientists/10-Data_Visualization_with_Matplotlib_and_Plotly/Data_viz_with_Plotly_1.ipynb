    "# Interactive Visualizations with Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly is a library which helps create interactive, deployable and publication-ready graphs. The library allows graph building in multiple languages like Python, R, Matlab and Javascript. In this course we will learn the python implementations to building interactive plots using plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly library is very powerful and many features. Simple graphs, 3D plots, Dashboards, APIs, Animations etc. can be constructed using Plotly. In this course we will learn how to create simple graphs, 3D plots and some basic dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly was initially written in javascript, and named plotly.js. Support for all other languages is in the form of respective APIs which process native code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>A note before we begin: Plotly is a very well documented library. All the example code (other than the exercises) you see in this course is taken from the Plotly documentation. Refer to Plotly documentation to learn more about various graphs available (https://plot.ly/python).</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple import statement can be used to import plotly library. The version of the plotly library that is installed can be checked using 'plotly.__version__' statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly\n",
    "plotly.__version__\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> '2.7.0'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting graphs with Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main modules in Plotly that are important for creating graphs. They are:\n",
    "* plotly.plotly - This module contains functions which can be used to communicate with Plotly servers. A Plotly server is the core visualization engine that processes the native API code.\n",
    "* plotly.offline - This module enables plotly to run in offline mode by downloading and including javascript libraries into the Jupyter kernel evironment. <b>We will use this module to learn plotly within this course.</b>\n",
    "* graph_objs - Each graph is an object. This module contains functions which generate graph objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 parts to every graph:\n",
    "1. Data or Trace: This is usually a Python list object and contains all the data that we would want to plot. A trace is a collection of data points and their specifications that we would want to plot.\n",
    "2. Layout: This object is used to change the features of the graph like axis titles, spacing, fonts etc. which are unrelated to the data itself.\n",
    "3. Figure: This is a dictionary-like object which contains both the data object and the layout object and this defines the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to start creating graphs using plotly, we need to import both 'plotly' and 'graph_objs' modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly.plotly as ply\n",
    "import plotly.offline as ofl\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objs as go\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The common alias used for plotly.plotly module is 'py', but this may lead to confusion as it is a common extension for python files. We recommend using 'ply' as the alias for plotly.plotly module.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Initializing notebook mode:</b> Plotly was designed to render graphs on a web server or a local port. In order to render the plots inside the jupyter notebook, the notebook mode of plotly must be initialized. Without initializing notebook mode, no plotly plots can be visualized within this notebook (or any jupyter notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax to enable notebook mode is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize notebook mode\n",
    "ofl.init_notebook_mode()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import plotly library and find out what version of plotly is installed (refer to code in above lesson)\n",
    "* Import plotly offline and graph_objs modules from the plotly library (refer to code in above lesson)\n",
    "* Initialize notebook mode so all plotly plots will be visualized within this notebook (refer to code in above lesson)"

    "## Simple graphs in Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of simple plots that can be built using plotly. Some of the plots that are commonly used by Data Scientists, which we will learn in this course, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scatter plots\n",

    "\n",
    "### Scatter plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots are simple point graphs which are used to plot observations on a coordinate system. If the coordinate system has two dimensions it is a 2D plot and if it has 3 dimensions it becomes a 3D scatter plot. N-dimensional observations cannot be plotted and visualized for obvious reasons (limitations of technology and human perception).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how we can construct a scatter plot on plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 - Defining the trace object\n",
    "\n",
    "The trace object consists of the data and some plot formatting options. We can specify the observations for each feature as an array, i.e., If $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are 3 predictors and $y$ is the predicted variable, then data may be specified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1 = [1,2,3]$,\n",
    "$x_2 = [4,5,6]$,\n",
    "$x_3 = [7,8,9]$,\n",
    "$y = [12,15,18]$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above scenario, observation $O_1$ would be $x_1=1,\\ x_2=4,\\ x_3=7 \\ and \\ y=12$; $O_2$ would be $x_1=2,\\ x_2=5,\\ x_3=8 \\ and \\ y=15$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us assume there is only one predictor $x$ and one predicted variable $y$. Let $x=[1,2,3]$ and $y=[4,5,6]$.\n",
    "The code to create a trace with above given data would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "trace1 = go.Scatter(x=[1,2,3], y=[4,5,6], marker={'color': 'red', 'symbol': 104, 'size': 10}, \n",
    "                    mode=\"markers+lines\",  text=[\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"], name='1st Trace')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Multi-dimensional data is difficult to visualize using traditional plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the trace we have created has a scatter plot object created. The object includes both data (x and y) and formatting options for the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a trace with $x$ as numbers from 1 to 30 and $y$ to be the 'square of $x$' ($y=x^2$) using a scatter plot object. You may use the same format options (apart from $x$ and $y$) as above example code."

    "\n",
    "The data object consists of the data we would want to plot in the format that is consumable by plotly engine. We can use the trace object and recast it into a list, and then use it as the data object. This is because the Figure object which we would create in Step 3 only accepts a list or tuple as data object. The syntax to convert a trace object into a list is to simply enclose the trace object in square braces:\n",

    "In bar charts too, there is a provision to represent multiple series on the same plot. The way we represent multiple series in a bar chart is:\n",
    "1. Create multiple traces that you want to plot and add them to the data object.\n",
    "2. While creating the layout object, use a parameter called 'barmode'. You may set barmode to 'group' or 'stack'.\n",
    "3. Create figure object using data and layout objects and visualize the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say I want to compare the giraffe, orangutan and monkeys counts of San Franciso Zoo to the Los Angeles Zoo. We can construct two traces, one for each data series, and visualize both series as a grouped bar chart or a stacked bar chart.\n",

    "### Bubble charts\n",
    "\n",
    "The bubble chart is a specialized scatter plot. In a typical 2-dimensional scatter plot, observations have 2 dimensions/features - x and y. The bubble chart has the capability to present multiple dimensions/features of observations in a single plot. The typical observations of a scatter plot shown in the form of dots or tiny circles can be increased to show variable sized circles depicting each observation. The size of each circle may be determined by a 'third feature' of the observation. The color of the circle may be determined by the 'fourth feature' of the observation or data set. The plot would showcase multiple sized circles scattered across the X-Y coordinate system. This is called a Bubble chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bubble chart can be created from a scatter plot object by modifying the 'marker' dictionary. The parameters that can be modified to create a bubble chart are:\n",
    "1. size - this parameter/key can take a list of values. The list should be the same length as the number of observations. It determines the size of each bubble.\n",
    "2. color - this parameter/key can take a list of values. The list should be the same length as the number of observations. It determines the color of each bubble.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note: It is important to observe that the fourth feature that can be represented using color of the bubble needs to be a categorical variable. Also, the third feature which is represented by size of bubble is generally numerical in nature.</b>\n",
