    "## Generating array with random numbers - the numpy.random module\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy library has a sub-module called 'random', which is used to generate random numbers for a given distribution. It is especially useful for randomly sampling data for specific experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module contains functions which\n",
    "1. enables random sampling from simple data\n",
    "2. enables random sampling from well known data distributions\n",
    "3. Permutations and other functions like shuffling and seeding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Sampling random numbers from simple data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### rand() function\n",
    "\n",
    "The rand() function randomly selects numbers from a 'uniform distribution' in the range [0,1), i.e., zero inclusive and 1 exclusive. When we say the distribution is uniform, we mean to say that there is equal probability of any number between 0 and 1 getting selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### randn() function\n",
    "\n",
    "The randn() function randomly selects numbers from a 'standard normal distribution' with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, i.e., there is equal chance of a positive or negative number getting selected, with a higher chance of a number closer to 0 getting selected and chances dimming down as the value is farther away from the mean 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### randint() function\n",
    "\n",
    "The randint() function randomly selects integers from a given range of numbers. Since this selects only integers between the given range of numbers, it is called a 'discrete uniform distribution' as there is equal chance of any integer getting selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Importing numpy library\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "np.random.rand(5)\n",
