    "## Arrays and Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting introduced to Numpy library, we need to be familiar with a very widely used data structure called 'array'. An **array** is a collection of homogenous elements. Here homogenous means elements of the same data type. And so an array can be a collection of integers (*int* datatypes), collection of fractions/decimal values (*float* datatypes) or a collection of characters (*char* datatype) also referred to as a *string*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **list** is very similar to an array in structure differing only by the characteristic that, a list is a collection of heterogenous elements, i.e. elements with various datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/arrayvslist.png\" width=\"800\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both arrays and lists can be accessed in the same way, using an index, which is a reference to the position of the element within the collection. Index begins from zero and ends with n-1, where n is the total length of the array (which is the number of elements in the array or list).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. NumPy Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a library in Python that supports creation and operations on large, multidimensional arrays and matrices. It facilitates scientific and numeric computing with high level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy object is generally a multi-dimensional array. It is a table of elements with the same data type (int, float, char, etc.), indexed by a tuple of positive integers (also called *indices*). In Numpy, dimensions are called *axes*. The number of axes is *rank*. (ref: scipy.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 3D space of x, y and z coordinates. A  point in 3D space [1.0, 3.0, 5.0] is an array of rank 1. If there are several such points as shown below, then the dimensions are of the nature m by n. In the example shown below, there are 4 rows and 3 columns (i.e., 3 elements or values for each point/observation), this translates to an n-dimensional array with a shape of 4 by 3.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[ 1.0, 0.3, 4.5],\n",
    " [ 0.5, 1.5, 2.3],\n",
    " [ 6.0, 4.6, 3.5],\n",
    " [ 4.5, 3.5, 6.3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use a library, we need to import them. Any python library can be referenced by an alias that is mentioned during the import. For example, NumPy library is most commonly imported in the short form as np:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Importing the numpy library\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to initialize an array in numpy :\n",
    "* a = np.array([0,1,2,3])   ...   creates an array of rank (or dimensionality) 1\n",
    "* a = np.array([[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]])   ...   creates a 2x4 matrix  \n",
    "* a = np.ones((3,3))   ...   creates a 3x3 matrix with all 1s\n",
    "* a = np.zeroes((2,2))   ...   creates a 2x2 matrix with all 0s\n",
    "* a = np.eye(3)   ...   creates a 3x3 matrix with 1s at the diagonal and 0s otherwise (i.e. an identity matrix)\n",

    "## 2. Casting a non-array datatype into an array\n",
    "\n",
    "The np.array() method can be used to convert a variable of any data type into an n-dimensional array. By simply passing the variable as an argument to this function, we can convert the variable which can be an integer, float, list, series or dataframe into an n-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "type(a)\n",
    ">>> int\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array(a)\n",

An array can be defined using the '.array' method of the numpy module. A range of functions such as dtype, shape, size, etc., are available to find out about various attributes of the array.\n",
