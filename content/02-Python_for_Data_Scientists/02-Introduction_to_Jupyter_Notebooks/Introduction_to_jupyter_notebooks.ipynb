    "Through Jupyter's kernel and messaging architecture, the Notebook allows code to be run in a range of different programming languages.  For each notebook document that a user opens, the web application starts a kernel that runs the code for that notebook. Each kernel is capable of running code in a single programming language and there are kernels available in the following languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python(https://github.com/ipython/ipython)\n",

    "Each of these kernels communicate with the notebook web application and web browser using a JSON over ZeroMQ/WebSockets message protocol that is described [here](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html#messaging). Most users don't need to know about these details, but it helps to understand that \"kernels run code.\""

    "\n",
    "At the top towards the left is the notebook title area. Clicking on it brings the 'Rename Notebook' dialog.\n",
    "In this dialog, you could change the name of the notebook, which is also the file name of the ipynb file.\n",

    "#### Insert Menu\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert menu has two menu items - insert cell above and insert cell below - which are used to add new cells to the notebook. \"Insert Cell Above\" action inserts a new cell above the currently selected cell. Similarly, \"Insert Cell Below\" action, inserts a new cell below the currently selected cell. By default the cells are of type code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cell Menu\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell Menu contains actions such as \"Run Cell\", \"Run All\", \"Run All Above\", \"Run All Below\". \"Run Cell\" action is used to execute the code (or Markdown) and display the output for the currently highlighted cell. All of the other menu items have similar actions with variations or additional actions. For example \"Run All\" executes all the cells in the notebook. \"Run All Below\" executes all the cells below the current selected cell. Similarly \"Run All Above\" exectues all the cells above the current cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool bar\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool bar consists of standard icons/buttons for actions such as Save, Insert Cell (Below), Cut cells, Copy Cells, Paste Cells and buttons to re-order cells to move above and below. Some of the prominently used icons are the \"Run cell\", \"Stop Kernel\" buttons and the \"Change Cell Type\" dropdown. \n",

    "\n",
    "The cell is the main content area. In this example, the type of cell is code cell. In our case python code can be written and executed by the python3 kernel. The code cell (kernel) could also be of other programming languages such as R or Julia, depending on the kernel installed. Similarly, there are other types of cells besides the code cell such as Markdown. We will discuss this later in this lesson.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above screenshot, besides the menubar and toolbar, you could also see the cell mode indicator and the kernel indicator. \n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel indicator is on the right end of the menu bar pane. In this case the kernel is a \"Python 3\" kernel indicating that this notebook can execute python 3 language code in code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell mode indicator is the color code to the left of the cell content area and the border together. If it is in blue color, it is said to be in Command Mode. If the border is in Green color, it is in Edit Mode as shown in the below image. Upon pressing Enter or clicking in the cell takes it to edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a cell is in edit mode, the Cell Mode Indicator will change to reflect the cell’s state. This state is indicated by a small pencil icon on the top right of the interface. When the cell is in command mode, there is no icon in that location.\n",

    "## Code Cells  Vs Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the previous section, the cells are of different types. Two of the main types are Code Cells and Markdown cells. Once you’ve selected a Notebook to edit, the Notebook will open in the Notebook Editor. The cells can be edited and also executed while the notebook is open in the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Cells\n",

    "Code Cells are meant for writing code in the programming language supported by the kernel. In this case it is python3. The language supported is displayed in the Kernel indicator.\n",

    "### Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be added to Jupyter Notebooks using Markdown cells. You can change the cell type to Markdown by using the Cell menu, the toolbar, or the key shortcut m. Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML. Its specification can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Basics\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "# Heading 1\n",
    "# Heading 2\n",
    "## Heading 2.1\n",
    "## Heading 2.2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "    def f(x):\n",
    "        \"\"\"a docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "        return x**2\n",

    "      x += 4;\n",
