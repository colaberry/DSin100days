(i.e., If x='Hello', then 'x' is automatically identified by python as a string variable. If 'x' is re-assigned a value of 12.6, say x=12.6, then 'x' is automatically identified as a float)"

    "### Format specifiers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to put a placeholder for a variable and pass the value to the function separately, we can use something called format specifier. This is typically a set of symbols which tell the function about the format in which the value being passed is to be printed. Format specifiers for various types of data types in Python are similar to other programming languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* %d for integer\n",
    "* %f for float\n",
    "* %s for string\n",
    "* %r for raw object using 'repr' method\n",
    "* %x for hex code\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the format specifiers as placeholders in a print statement, and pass the value of a specific variable using the '%' operator. Multiple variables/values can also be passed by enclosing all variables in paranthesis and separating them by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"I want to print %d and %d in the same sentence\"%(a,b))\n",

    "# Output\n",
    ">>> I want to print 10 and 5 in the same sentence\n",

    "# Output\n",
    ">>> I want to print 10.264725 and a string type in the same sentence\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternative to the '%' operator, we have the format() function which can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above example, where we had a float value, we may want to restrict the number of decimals and print a rounded value. On the other hand we may want to add a preceeding zero to the number, in case the value a here is a single observation in a larger pool of numbers which have 3 digits before the decimal.\n",
    "We can add preceeding zeroes and round off float values by specifying the type of formatting for a float, after the '%' symbol and before the 'f' symbol of the format specifier.\n",
    "* Use a period symbol ('.') to denote the decimal in the float value\n",
    "* For preceeding zeroes, add total desired length of the number (including decimal point), in digits, before the period symbol. And before this number, add a '0' to denote that all preceeding blank spaces need to be filled with zeroes.\n",
    "* For rounding off decimals, add the number up to which you want decimals, right after the period symbol and before the 'f' symbol\n",

    "1. {:.2f}\n",

    "5. {:8.4f}\n",

    ">>> 4. 10.2647\n",
    ">>> 5.  10.2647\n",
    ">>> 6. 010.2647\n",
    ">>> 7. 00010.2647\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Important note:</b> In above example '{:4.4f}' and '{04.4f}' give the same output, where we cannot see any padding (neither blanks nor zeroes). This is because the length that we specified for the string is 4, whereas we have also asked for 4 digits after the decimal point. So the digits after decimal take precedence and these 4 digits are added first.\n",
    "Then the whole number is generated - the characteristic (digits before decimal) and the mantissa (digits after the decimal). After this the control checks to add padding. It now finds that the condition for length of number we have specified is 4, and the length of number is already more than 4, hence it does not add any padding blanks or zeroes.\n",

    "### Membership Operator (in)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code 'x in y', if x is a subset of y, then the result is True:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# list\n",
    "a = [1,2.35,\"Hello\",\"cat\",114]\n",
    "\n",
    "# \"\\n\" creates a new line while printing\n",
    "print(\" Is 15 in list a:\", 15 in a, \"\\n\", \"Is 'cat' in list a:\", 'cat' in a, \"\\n\", \"Is 'dog' in list a:\", 'dog' in a, \"\\n\", \"Is 'H' in the word 'Hello':\", 'H' in 'Hello', \"\\n\", \"Is 'd' in the word 'cat':\", 'd' in 'cat')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> Is 15 in list a: False \n",
    ">>> Is 'cat' in list a: True \n",
    ">>> Is 'dog' in list a: False \n",
    ">>> Is 'H' in the word 'Hello': True \n",
    ">>> Is 'd' in the word 'cat': False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'in' operator is frequently used as a iterator which runs through every element of a list, tuple or string, while using decision statements or loops. We will see more usage of 'in' when we learn about loops and decision statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identity Operators (is) and the id() function\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to check the memory location of a variable in Python, we use the id() function. When we pass a variable as an argument to the id() function, it returns a integer which represents the memory location of the given variable.\n",
    "Identity operators compare the memory locations of two python objects and returns True if they point to the same location. 'is' is such an operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two objects can contain the same value but can be different objects, stored at different memory locations. Here is an example which illustrates the 'is' operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "c = 5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Location of a:\", id(a), \"; Location of b:\", id(b), \"; Is a same as b:\", a is b)\n",
    "print(\"Location of a:\", id(a), \"; Location of c:\", id(c), \"; Is a same as c:\", a is c)\n",
    "print(\"Is a equal to b:\", a==b, \"\\n\", \"Is a equal to c:\", a==c)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> Location of a: 10919552 ; Location of b: 10919552 ; Is a same as b: True\n",
    ">>> Location of a: 10919552 ; Location of c: 140045356024168 ; Is a same as c: False\n",
    ">>> Is a equal to b: True\n",
    ">>> Is a equal to c: True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2\n",
    "a = 'This '\n",
    "b = a + 'is a python tutorial'\n",
    "c = 'This is a python tutorial'\n",
    "\n",
    "b == c\n",
    ">>> True\n",
    "b is c\n",
    ">>> False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> In above example we can see that when we initialized two variables 'a' and 'b' within the same block with the same value, they were both pointing to the same location. Python saves memory in this way, by referring to the same object, when values are same, instead of creating a new object. When some operations are performed on 'a' and 'b' they take up different values and that is when the memory location they reference would change based on which value they would be taking.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 3\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "c = 5\n",
    "\n",

    "print(\"Location of a:\", id(a), \"; Location of c:\", id(c), \"; Is a same as c:\", a is c)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Manipulating a,b and c\n",
    "a = 2*a\n",
    "b = 2*b\n",
    "c = 3*c\n",
    "\n",
    "# After operating on a,b and c\n",
    "print(\"Location of a:\", id(a), \"; Location of b:\", id(b), \"; Is a same as b:\", a is b)\n",
