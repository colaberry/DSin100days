    "\n",
    "Indexing in Python is really advanced and helps retrieve elements of a list in more than just the traditional way. We have seen some simple indexing above. In this section we will have a look at some advanced indexing which would help retrieve elements satisfying some simple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The colon and string reversal using indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages a string is a list/array of characters. So the string reversal operations are the same (or similar) to array or list reversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The colon plays an important part in indexing in Python.\n",
    "* Using a single colon to separate two indices: The number on the left side of the colon is the lower index (generally inclusive) and the number on the right side of the colon is the upper index (generally exclusive). This notation retrieves all elements of the list starting from the lower index up to the upper index.\n",
    "* Using two colons to separate two indices and an iterator: A second colon can be used to separate the upper index with an iterator. The iterator is a number which determines the increment the index will take while traversing the list/array. By default this number is '1', so the index increases one place at a time, i.e., next index = previous index + increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single colon example\n",
    "\n",
    "a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10] # Defining the list\n",
    "a[2:6] # 2 is lower index and 6 is upper index\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> [3, 4, 5, 6] # Output\n",
    "\n",
    "# Double colon example\n",
    "\n",
    "a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10] # Defining the list\n",
    "a[2:6:2] # 2 is lower index and 6 is upper index and 2 is iterator/increment in index\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> [3, 5] # Output\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another double colon example\n",
    "\n",
    "a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10] # Defining the list\n",
    "a[::2] # 0 is lower index and len(a)-1 is upper index and 2 is iterator/increment in index\n",

    ">>> [1, 3, 5, 8] # Output\n",

    "\n",
    ">>> [2, 4, 6, 10] # Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what would happen if the iterator were to be set to a negative number, say -1. The list would be traversed and elements retrieved in a reverse order. This is how we can actually perform a list/string reversal.\n",

But when the second element is inserted, this element faces the front end and the first element takes the rear end.

    "As you can see in the example, the sub-lists, i.e.,the lists inside the outer list can be accessed just like any other element, using the indices. In order to access the element within the nested list, we use another set of braces and the second index to indicate the position in the nested list.\n",
