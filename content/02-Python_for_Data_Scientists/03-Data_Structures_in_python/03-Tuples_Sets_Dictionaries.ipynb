    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is a sequence of immutable sequential objects, i.e., Once they are declared, they cannot be edited or changed. Tuples <b>use parentheses</b> for declaration and access unlike lists and cannot be changed. It is an ordered sequence and used for objects such as coordinates that contain latitude, longitude. They can also be used to denote any data which you would want to be read only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "loc = (30.456, 50.436)\n",
    "atup = (12,35,123,\"hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# printing the tuple and confirming the data type of variable as tuple\n",
    "print(atup,type(atup))\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> (12, 35, 123, 'hello') <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Checking whether hello is present in the tuple and retrieving 3rd element of the tuple\n",
    "print('hello' in atup, atup[2])\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> True 123\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Packing and Unpacking a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples can be accessed using the indices, just like a list, array or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "atup = (12,35,123,\"hello\")\n",
    "print(atup[2],atup[:2])\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> 123 (12, 35)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, using indices we cannot access specific objects unless we know their position in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main uses of tuples is when we are entering records of values pertaining to a certain sequence of keys, i.e., Lets say we have a table of data with name, address, email id as three columns.\n",
    "* The column names are the keys and each row, pertaining to a specific individual/entity is a set of values.\n",
    "* Assume that we are expected to provide read access to this data but not allow manipulation of the same.\n",
    "* Each record/row can then be defined as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now packing a tuple is where in we define a tuple out of a sepcific set of values. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is called packing a tuple\n",
    "Person_1 = (\"John Doe\", \"john.doe@gmail.com\", \"31 Chandler Street, Phoenix, Arizona 02411\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpacking a tuple is where in we define the raw structure (referred here as first tuple) of a tuple, which contains labels (keys or variable names) and assign a tuple (containing values, this is referred to here as the second tuple) to it. The values from the second tuple get attached to the labels in the first tuple. An example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is called unpacking a tuple\n",
    "(name, email, address) = Person_1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"The name of the person is {:s} and their email id is {:s}\".format(name,email))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> The name of the person is John Doe and their email id is john.doe@gmail.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Adding an element to a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the existing contents of the tuple are immutable, we can add additional objects to a tuple and create a new tuple, or even add two tuples to create a new one. The following are examples to show how to add additional objects to a tuple and also how to add two tuples to create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "loc = (30.456, 50.436)\n",
    "atup = (12,35,123,\"hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# adding two tuples\n",
    "loc = loc + atup\n",
    "# adding a new object to atup\n",
    "atup = atup + (\"I can add an object\",)\n",
    "\n",
    "# printing the new tuples\n",
    "print(loc,type(loc),\"\\n\",atup,type(atup))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> (30.456, 50.436, 12, 35, 123, 'hello') <class 'tuple'>\n",
    ">>> (12, 35, 123, 'hello', 'I can add an object') <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ref: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a tuple with the following objects:\n",
    "* Your name\n",
    "* Your email id\n",
    "* Your mailing address\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the tuple is initialized, add your phone number to the tuple. You may use string type for all objects.\n",
    "* Print the tuple and also the type (using type()) to confirm that the object is indeed a tuple"

    "## Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is an unordered <b>collection of unique objects</b>. Sets are collection types and very useful for Mathematicians, Statisticians and Data Scientists. It is equivalent to the mathematical definition of sets. Sets in python are defined using the function 'set()'. Any list, or array type can also be recast into a set, using the set() function.\n",
    "\n",

    "Note that by definition a set is an <b>'unordered'</b> collection of objects. In the above output, the set form of list_A is printed in a sorted order. However, that is merely the output of the set() function and that is not how the elements in the set itself are organized. The set does not support indexing as the elements/objects are not stored in any specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using sets to reduce the search space:</b>\n",
    "One way we can use sets is if we would like to check the existence of a certain object in a very large collection of frequently repeating objects.

Then the decreased range is easier to iterate through and find the existence of the current object using the 'in' membership operator.\n",
