    "You are given a garbled telephone directory as a string. Write a program to retrieve the phone numbers and names.\n",
    "In the input text, the names and phone numbers are mixed with some garbled text. Names start with Name:<First Last> and interspersed with some text. Finally the 10 digit phone number in the format 123-456-7890 along with some mixed text.\n",
    "You are reguired to extract 3 names and phone numbers and assign it to a list of dictionaries\n",
