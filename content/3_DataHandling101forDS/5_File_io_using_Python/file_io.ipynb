    "| w | To write a file; Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist, truncates if it does |\n",
    "| a\t| To append at the end of the file; Creates a new file if doesn’t exist |\n",
    "| t\t| Text mode |\n",
    "| b\t| Binary mode |\n",
    "| + | To open a file for updating (read & write)|\n",

    "## 2. Read File\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to read a file in Python, let's see them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The read() method\n",
    "\n",
    "The **read()** method is Python's basic way of reading an input file. It reads all the data character by character; You can provide an integer argument to read(), it reads that many characters from the beginning of the Python file. The read() function returns newline as '\\n'. Once the end of file is reached, we get empty string on further reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_rd = open(\"../data/sample_text.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "file_rd.read(15)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Seek() and tell()\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change our current file cursor (position) using the **seek()** method. Seek() takes an integer argument, and positions the cursor after that many characters in the Python file. Along with that, it returns this new position of the cursor. Now using the read() method, reads from where the cursor is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_rd.seek(10)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the **tell()** method returns our current position (in number of bytes). \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_rd.tell()\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Using Python For-loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We can read a file line-by-line using a **for loop**. This is both efficient and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for line in file_rd:\n",
    "    print(line, end = '')\n",
    "    \n",
    ">>>\n",
    "I would love to try or hear the sample audio your app can produce.\n",
    "I do not want to purchase, because I've purchased so many apps that say they do something and do not deliver. \n",
    "Can you please add audio samples with text you've converted? I'd love to see the end results.\n",
    "Thanks!\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note** that the lines in file itself have a newline character '\\n', which produces two newlines when printing. Hence we need to use the **'end'** parameter to avoid this. Alternately we can use readline() method to read individual lines of a file\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Readline() & Readlines()\n",
    "\n",
    "* **readline()** <br>\n",
    "The **readline()** method lets us read one line at a time. Simply put, the interpreter stops after every ‘\\n’.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_rd.seek(0)\n",
    "file_rd.readline()\n",

    "'I would love to try or hear the sample audio your app can produce.\\n'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **readlines()** <br>\n",
    "Lastly, the **readlines()** method reads the rest of the lines/file.\n",
