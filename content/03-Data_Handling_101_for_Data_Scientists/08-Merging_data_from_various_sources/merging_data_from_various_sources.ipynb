    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will look at various options such as concatenate, join and merge dataframes.\n",
    "The pandas library provides various facilities for easily combining together Series, DataFrame, and Panel objects with various kinds of set logic for the indexes and relational algebra functionality in the case of join / merge-type operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will look closely at using these facilities on Dataframes.\n",

    "## Concatenate\n",
    "\n",
    "The concat() function in pandas takes a list or dict of homogeneously-typed objects and concatenates them into one resulting object. It does all of the heavy lifting of performing concatenation operations along an axis while performing optional set logic (union or intersection) of the indexes (if any) on the other axes. \n",
