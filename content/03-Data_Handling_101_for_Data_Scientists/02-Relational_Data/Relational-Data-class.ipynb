    "# Relational Data\n",
    "With the recent exploit how much insight data can give stackholders,data and its exploration has become a go word on every entrepreneur,business leaders and even customers, lips.How data from different aspects of the business relate is core foundation on most data exploitation is done.\n",

    "## What is Relational Data?\n",
    "Today understand what relational data is we need to understand what relational database is.\n",
    "A relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.Relational data are those data stored in a relational database.<br>\n",
    "Example of relational data at work will be say, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number and so forth. Another table would describe an order: product, customer, date, sales price and so forth. A user of a relational database can then obtain a view of the database to fit their needs. For example, a branch office manager might like a view or report on all customers that bought products after a certain date. A financial services manager in the same company could, from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that need to be paid.Here,customers data is used in relation to order data to prepare a report.<br>\n",
    "Relational data stored on tables are in turn organized into one or more data categories in **columns** or **attributes**.A columns contain rows or **tuple** of values.Tuple is an order set of values separated by commas.In python tuple is also a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Database Management System\n",
    "In order to properly manage relational data in relational database we need relationa database management system(RDBMS).RDBMS is a program that allows you to create,update, and administer a relational database,most relational database management systems use the SQL(structure Query Language) language to access the database.<br>\n",
    "The skeleton structure that represent the logical view of the entire database in SQL is known as **Database schema** .Database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database. It can exist both as a visual representation and as a set of formulas known as integrity constraints that govern a database. .It also defines the different entities in the database  and the relationship amongst them.\n",
    "Database schema can be divided broadly into two categories-<br>\n",
    "<li>**Physical Database Schema**-this schema pertains to the actual storage of data and its form of storage like files, indices, etc. It defines how the data will be stored in a secondary storage.</li>\n",
    "<li>**Logical Database Schema**-This schema defines all the logical constraints that need to be applied on the data stored. It defines tables, views, and integrity constraints.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexes\n",
    "Have you searched for something on the computer and wondered how the information seemed to magically appear? How did the computer know exactly what you were searching for and retrieve it for you? Was it the elves who live in the computer? No, most likely it was a database index that located the specific information.<br>\n",
    "So,database index makes searching for particular data from your database faster.A database index allows a query to efficiently retrieve data from a database. Indexes are related to specific tables and consist of one or more keys.  A table can have more than one index built from it. The keys are a fancy term for the values we want to look up in the index. The keys are based on the tables’ columns. By comparing keys to the index it is possible to find one or more database records with the same value.<br>\n",
    "A database tables or view can contain the following types of indexes:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustered\n",
    "<li>Clustered indexes sort and store the data rows in the table or view based on their key values. These are the columns included in the index definition. There can be only one clustered index per table, because the data rows themselves can be stored in only one order.</li>\n",
    "<li>The only time the data rows in a table are stored in sorted order is when the table contains a clustered index. When a table has a clustered index, the table is called a clustered table. If a table has no clustered index, its data rows are stored in an unordered structure called a heap.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nonclustered\n",
    "<li>Nonclustered indexes have a structure separate from the data rows. A nonclustered index contains the nonclustered index key values and each key value entry has a pointer to the data row that contains the key value.</li>\n",
    "<li>The pointer from an index row in a nonclustered index to a data row is called a row locator. The structure of the row locator depends on whether the data pages are stored in a heap or a clustered table. For a heap, a row locator is a pointer to the row. For a clustered table, the row locator is the clustered index key.</li>\n",
    "Both clustered and nonclustered indexes can be unique. This means no two rows can have the same value for the index key. Otherwise, the index is not unique and multiple rows can share the same key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constriants\n",
    "Inorder to ensure that the data types and format inserted and maintained in the database tables,the database schema introduces constraints to achieve this,these constraints are expressed interms of keys.\n",
    "#### Types of Constraints:\n",
    "<li>Primary key constraint</li>\n",
    "A primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. It can either be part of the actual record itself , or it can be an artificial field (one that has no meaning other than being an identifier of the record).<br>\n",
    "A primary key can consist of one or more columns on a table. When multiple columns are used as a primary key, they are called a **composite key**.<br>\n",
    "A primary key cannot be NULL, as it does not make sense to use the NULL value to uniquely identify a record. Therefore, the column that is set as a primary key or as part of a primary key cannot be NULL.Primary keys can be specified either when the table is created (using CREATE TABLE) or by changing the existing table structure (using ALTER TABLE).\n",
    "<li>Foreign key constraint</li>\n",
    "A foreign key is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. The purpose of the foreign key is to ensure referential integrity of the data. In other words, only values that are supposed to appear in the database are permitted.<br>\n",
    "For example, say we have two tables, a CUSTOMER table that includes all customer data, and an ORDERS table that includes all customer orders. Business logic requires that all orders must be associated with a customer that is already in the CUSTOMER table. To enforce this logic, we place a foreign key on the ORDERS table and have it reference the primary key of the CUSTOMER table. This way, we can ensure that all orders in the ORDERS table are related to a customer in the CUSTOMER table. In other words, the ORDERS table cannot contain information on a customer that is not in the CUSTOMER table.<br>\n",
    "It is worth noting that foreign keys allow NULL, as we said above,primary key does not. In addition, a foreign key does not always have to reference a primary key of another table. It can also reference a column that has the UNIQUE constraint.\n",
    "<li>Check constraint</li>\n",
    "The check constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions. Once defined, the database will only insert a new row or update an existing row if the new value satisfies the check constraint. The CHECK constraint is used to ensure data quality.For example if you have a table with a column say age and it has the following property:<br>\n",
    "Age int,CHECK (Age>=18),then no age on that column will be above 18.\n",
    "<li>Unique constraint</li>\n",
    "The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.\n",
    "However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction SQL\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a computer language aimed to store, manipulate, and query data stored in relational databases. The first incarnation of SQL appeared in 1974, when a group in IBM developed the first prototype of a relational database. The first commercial relational database was released by Relational Software (later becoming Oracle). SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.<br>\n",
    "**Why SQL** <br>\n",
    "SQL is highly popular because it offers the following advantages:<br>\n",
    "<li>Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems</li>\n",
    "<li>Allows users to describe the data.</li>\n",
    "<li>Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.</li>\n",
    "<li>SQL queries can be optimized</li>\n",
    "<li>SQL is extensible,Explaoring the use of libraries,modules and pre-compilers</li>\n",
    "<li>Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.</li>\n",
    "<li>Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database and also create and drop tables</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Commands\n",
    "The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP. These commands can be classified into the following groups based on their nature −\n",
    "#### Data defination Langauge\n",
    "<li> **Create**: Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in the database.</li>\n",
    "<li> **Alter**: Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.</li>\n",
    "<li> **Drop**: Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other objects in the database.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data manipuation Langauge\n",
    "<li> **Select**: Retrieves certain records from one or more tables.</li>\n",
    "<li> **Insert**:Creates a record.</li>\n",
    "<li> **Update**: Modifies records.</li>\n",
    "<li> **Delete**: Deletes records.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensions\n",
    "A dimension table provides the description behind the analytic numbers.  It describes the who, what, when, where and why behind the facts. Dimensions are normally broken down into groups (tables) and they contain several attributes (columns).Dimension tables are not normalized.  Generally, dimension tables have many columns but a limited amount of rows. Dimension tables normally provide two purposes in a data warehouse, it can be used to filter queries and to select data.Example of dimension tables will be employee dimension,customer dimension,time dimension,location dimension etc.In order to provide a way to define a relationship between multiple attributes within a dimension, dimensions are organized into **dimensional hierarchies**.<br>\n",
    "Here, we shall look at **Slowly changing dimension** as a type of dimension, for further reading on the other types of dimensions check out this link [Types of dimensions](http://dwhlaureate.blogspot.com/2013/08/types-of-dimensions.html).<br>\n",
    "In SLowly changing dimension, dimension attributes  change slowly over a period of time.Example here will be attributes like name, address can change but not too often.<br>\n",
    "Datawarehouse engineers have developped a way of dealing with dimensions that changes over time.\n",
    "<li>**Type 1**: In type 1, the old record is over written.The advantage of type 1 is that it is very easy to follow and it results  in huge space savings and hence cost savings. The disadvantage is that no history is maintained</li>\n",
    "<li>**Type 2**:In type 2, the new record or row is added to hold the new information.For example if you are customer for credit card company and you moved and update your new address with the comapny, they wil just add new row understand your name with the new address.The advantage of type 2 is that the complete history is maintained. The only disadvantage lies in the huge space allocation because the entire history right from the start has to be maintained</li>\n",
    "<li>**Type 3**:In type 3, the approach is to add a new column instead of new row as in Type 2 to hold the updated information.In this case keeping a tracking of the history becomes very easy.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures\n",
    "In simple terms measures are numerical values of interest.These values corresponding to a particuler business process.Each row represents a single event associated with a process and contains the measurement data associated with that event.For example: sales is an important numerical metric that we wish to measure and perform analysis on.Measures are stored in fact tables.Since these facts are buneric in nature, they can be aggregated.For a numerical value to be of interest it has to be linked to an attribute in the dimension table.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fact tables and dimension tables are related to each other.Fact tables contain foreign keys which reference a primary key( this case a surrogate key) in the dimension table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Modeling and Architecture in OLTP Vs OLAP\n",
    "Data modeling is a representation of the data structures in a table for a company’s database and is a very powerful expression of the company's business requirements. This data model is the guide used by functional and technical analysts in the design and implementation of a database. \n",
    "Data models are used for many purposes, from high-level conceptual models to physical data models.<br>\n",
    "After understanding that data model are there to give us a description of data structure and the way date is organized,we need to understand this also esure that data redundancy is maintained at a required level and that data are properly normalized.\n",
    "#### Data redundancy\n",
    "Within the general definition of data redundancy, there are different classifications based on what is considered appropriate in database management, and what is considered excessive or wasteful. Wasteful data redundancy generally occurs when a given piece of data does not have to be repeated, but ends up being duplicated due to inefficient coding or process complexity. \n",
    "A positive type of data redundancy works to safeguard data and promote consistency. Many developers consider it acceptable for data to be stored in multiple places. The key is to have a central, master field or space for this data, so that there is a way to update all of the places where data is redundant through one central access point. Otherwise, data redundancy can lead to big problems with data inconsistency, where one update does not automatically update another field. As a result, pieces of data that are supposed to be identical end up having different values.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalization\n",
    "Normalization is a process that is carried out to minimize the redundancies that are present in data in relational databases. This process will mainly divide large tables in to smaller tables with fewer redundancies (called “Normal forms”). These smaller tables will be related to each other through well defined relationships. In a well normalized database, any alteration or modification in data will requires modifying only a single table. First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and the Third Normal Form (3NF) were introduced by Edgar F. Codd. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) was introduced in 1974 by Codd and Raymond F. Boyce. Higher Normal Forms (4NF, 5NF and 6NF) have been defined, but they are being used rarely.\n",
    "A table that complies with 1NF assures that it actually represents a relation (i.e. it does not contain any records that are repeating), and does not contain any attributes that are relational valued (i.e. all the attributes should have atomic values). For a table to comply with 2NF, it should be complied with 1NF and any attribute that is not a part of any candidate key (i.e. non-prime attributes) should fully depend on any of the candidate keys in the table. According to the Codd’s definition, a table is said to be in 3NF, if and only if, that table is in the second normal form (2NF) and every attribute in the table that do not belong to a candidate key should directly depend on every candidate key of that table. BCNF (also known as 3.5NF) captures some the anomalies that are not addressed by the 3NF\n",

    "### OLTP (On-line Transaction Processing) \n",
    "OLTP database is one characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).The main emphasis for OLTP systems is put on very fast query processing, maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments and an effectiveness measured by number of transactions per second. In OLTP database there is detailed and current data and the system helps in tracking all these business processes at very fast pace.Containing current data,OLTP reveals a snapshot of ongoing business processes.OLTP has highly normalized  tables in its database design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### OLAP(On-line Analytical Processing) \n",
    "OLAP database is characterized by relatively low volume of transactions. Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations. For OLAP systems a response time is an effectiveness measure. OLAP applications are widely used by Data Mining techniques. In OLAP database there is aggregated, historical data, stored in multi-dimensional schemas (usually star schema).OLAP are typically de-normalized with fewer tables; use of star and/or snowflake schemas.As analyical system it has multidimensional views of various kinds of business activities<br>\n",
