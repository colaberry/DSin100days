    "## Mean, Median and Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a large data set, it can be useful to represent the entire data set with a single value that describes the \"middle\" or \"average\" value of the entire set. In statistics, that single value is called the central tendency and mean, median and mode are all ways to describe it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the mean, add up the values in the data set and then divide by the number of values that you added. To find the median, list the values of the data set in numerical order and identify which value appears in the middle of the list. To find the mode, identify which value in the data set occurs most often. Range, which is the difference between the largest and smallest value in the data set, describes how well the central tendency represents the data. If the range is large, the central tendency is not as representative of the data as it would be if the range was small.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example - In data centers, IT professionals need to understand the definition of mean, median, mode and range to plan capacity and balance load, manage systems, perform maintenance and troubleshoot issues. These various tasks dictate that the administrator calculate mean, median, mode or range, or often some combination, to show a statistically significant quantity, trend or deviation from the norm. Finding the mean, median, mode and range is only the start. The administrator then needs to apply this information to investigate root causes of a problem, accurately forecast future needs or set acceptable working parameters for IT systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean \n",
    "The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated \"central\" value of a set of numbers. The statistical mean refers to the mean or average that is used to derive the central tendency of the data in question. It is determined by adding all the data points in a population and then dividing the total by the number of points. The resulting number is known as the mean or the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python we can use mean() to calculate the mean of a distribution.\n",
