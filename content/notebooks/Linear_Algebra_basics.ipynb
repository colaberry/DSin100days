    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics which deals with straight lines, vectors, matrices, multi-dimensional arrays (constructed using linear structures like straight lines or linear planes etc.) and the linear relationships or mappings among these constructs. A set of points or co-ordinates which satisfy a linear equation consitute a 'hyperplane' in an n-dimensional space. The intersection of two hyperplanes is a straight line and the intersections of multiple hyperplanes is a single point, generally regarded as the 'origin'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "A single number (generally rational number) is called a 'scalar'. A single point in space can be represented by a set of co-ordinates or scalars, and this is called a 'vector'. In programming parlance, a vector is an array of numbers (scalars). A Matrix is a 2-dimensional array of numbers, or a collection of vectors. A 'tensor' is a multi-dimensional array.\n",

    "A 'scalar' can be a numeric variable, an numpy array with numbers is a 'vector'. Similarly, a two-dimensional array can be a matrix and a multi-dimensional array is a 'tensor'. A tensor is generally defined as a geometric object which could represent the linear relationship between scalars, vectors or other tensors (Source: Wikipedia).\n",

    "\n",
    "Two matrices can be added, only if they have the same dimensions. While implementing matrices using numpy arrays, the shapes of both arrays need to match in order to perform addition. Same rules hold true for subtraction. For these operations, matrices can be treated as variables and '+' and '-' operators can be used to perform addition and subtraction.\n",

    "Two matrices can be multiplied with each other if the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix. The product of two matrices will be another matrix with dimensions as number of rows equal to the number of rows of first matrix and number of columns equal to the number of columns of the second matrix. Matrix multiplication is not element to element operation like addition and subtraction seen above. An element in the product is derived by the sum of products of elements in rows of first matrix and columns of second matrix. It is for this reason that length of each row in first matrix (i.e. number of columns in first matrix) should be equal to the length of each column in second matrix (i.e. number of rows in second matrix). This operation can be acheived by using either the 'dot' (dot product) function or the 'matmul' function in numpy module. These functions generally take two arguments, the two matrices which should be multiplied.\n",

    "Calculating the angle between two vectors is not a straight forward process in Python The following steps can be followed in order to find out the angle between any two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normalize the given vectors: Normalizing is the process of converting the length of a vector to '1' while preserving the direction of the vector. This can be done by dividing the vector with its second order norm.\n",
    "2. Dot product of Normalized vectors: Find out the dot product of the normalized vectors from above step using the numpy.dot function.\n",
    "3. Clipping the value of the dot product: As we are trying to calculate the angle between vectors using the law of cosines, we should note that the cosine function has a maximum value of '1' and minimum value of '-1'. The dot product calculated in previous step cannot have a value beyond these bounds. Hence we use the 'numpy.clip()' function to limit the result of the dot product. If the value of the dot product of the normalized vectors falls within -1 and 1, it retains its value. If it is less than -1 it assumes a value of -1 and if greater than 1, then it assumes a value of 1.\n",
    "4. Calculating angle using **cos<sup>-1</sup>** function: We have a value between -1 and 1 which we need to use to calculate the possible angle using the inverse cosine function. This can be acheived using the 'numpy.arccos()' function. Note that the arccos() function returns the angle in radians. In order to convert this result into degrees, the 'numpy.degrees()' function can be used.\n",

    "### Special Vectors and Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If a and b are non-zero vectors and **(a<sup>T</sup>)(b) = 0**, then it implies that **cos($\\theta$) = 0**. So, the angle between a and b would be 90 degrees and in such a condition a and b are called orthogonal vectors (with respect to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Symmetric Matrix: If **a = a<sup>T</sup>** then 'a' is a symmetric matrix\n",
    "* Orthogonal Matrix: If **a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>T</sup>** then 'a' is called an orthogonal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find out the second degree norms of given vectors 'v_one' and 'v_two'. Assign the norms to two variables 'v_one_norm' and 'v_two_norm' and print them out.\n",
    "* Normalize 'v_one' and 'v_two' by dividing them with their respective norms. Store the values in two variables called 'v_one_normvec' and 'v_two_normvec' and print them out.\n",
    "* Calculate the angle between 'v_one' and 'v_two'. Use the numpy.degrees function to convert the result of numpy.arccos function from radian into degrees. Assign the angle to a variable 'v_angle' and print it out.\n",
    "* Are 'v_one' and 'v_two' orthogonal vectors? If yes, store 'True' in the variable 'v_ortho' else store 'False'."
