    "## Merging data from multiple data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, you will learn about combining data from various sources. Data comes in many forms and types; hence it is essential for a data-driven decision maker to know how to merge datasets from disparate sources. A python is a preferred tool for this task since it can access data in multitudes of formats, and it provides objects like the data frame to store and manipulate data. In this article, we will fetch and combine data from three different sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A CSV file - Customer_Order table\n",
    "2. An SQL Database - sqlite\n",
    "3. An HTML web page\n",
    "\n",
    "All three sources will yield numeric and text data hence we can store them in a pandas database. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The image below shows how these various data sources are linked.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use python to import data from three different sources. Then convert each dataset to a pandas dataframe and combine the dataframes to generate a master dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pulling data from a csv file \n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to pull data from a csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "cust_order_link = '../../../data/Customer_Order.csv'\n",
    "# Reading data into tables\n",
    "df_csv_custorder = pd.read_csv(cust_order_link)\n",
    "df_csv_custorder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code will import the csv file into a pandas dataframe and display the dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pulling data from a SQL database \n",
    "\n",
    "The second block of code imports a SQL database file into pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "\n",
    "# Importing library\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connecting to the database\n",
    "oltp_con = sqlite3.connect(productdb_link)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a cursor on the database connection\n",
    "oltp_cur = oltp_con.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Executing query\n",
    "oltp_cur.execute('''SELECT * FROM product''')\n",
    "products = oltp_cur.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of tuples - conversion to Dataframe\n",
    "df_db_products = pd.DataFrame(products, columns=['productno', 'productname'])\n",
    "df_db_products\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL database is read by using the sqlite3 package. All columns from the product table are read and a dataframe is created with two columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pulling data from a html page\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step is to read data from HTML content on the web. The HTML page is: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colaberry/DSin100days/master/data/order-transactions.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The above link contains the HTML code for a page. Study the link to undestrand the different components of the HTML page (class, div tags) and use it to get transaction details with the following tags \n",
    "\n",
    "{\"orderno\": orderno , \"productno\" : productno , \"quantity\" : quantity , \"total\" : total}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "html = response.content\n",
    "\n",
    "soup = BeautifulSoup(html)\n",
    "tag = soup.find_all(\"div\", class_=\"transaction\")\n",
    "#print(tag)\n",
    "transactions = []\n",
    "\n",
    "for t in tag:\n",
    "    #print(t.span.text)\n",
    "    order = t.find(\"small\", class_=\"orderno\")\n",
    "    orderno = order.text\n",
    "    product = t.find(\"small\", class_=\"productno\")\n",
    "    productno = product.text\n",
    "    qty = t.find(\"small\", class_=\"quantity\")\n",
    "    quantity = qty.text\n",
    "    ttl = t.find(\"small\", class_=\"total\")\n",
    "    total = ttl.text\n",
    "    order_detail = {\"orderno\": orderno , \"productno\" : productno , \"quantity\" : quantity , \"total\" : total}\n",
    "    #print(order_detail)\n",
    "    transactions.append(order_detail)\n",
    "\n",
    "df_web_transactions = pd.DataFrame(transactions)\n",
    "df_web_transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, everything within the 'transaction' div is identified. Then for each transaction in the transaction div the order details are extracted and stored in a list called 'transactions'. This list is then converted to a pandas data frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining  the dataframes \n",
    "\n",
    "The three dataframes can be combined to get a master dataset that contains information from all the three sources: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
