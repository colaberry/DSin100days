    "## Arrays and Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting introduced to Numpy library, we need to be familiar with a very widely used data structure called 'array'. An array is a collection of homogenous variables. Here homogenous means variables of the same data type. And so an array can be a collection of integers (int datatypes), collection of fractions/decimal values (float datatypes) or a collection of characters (char datatype) also referred to as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list in very similar to an array in structure differing only by the characteristic that, a list is a collection of heterogenous variables, i.e., it can contain a mixture of variables with various datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/arrayvslist.png\" style=\"width:55vw; height:50vh;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Both arrays and lists can be accessed in the same way, using an index, which is a reference to the position of the element within the collection. Index begins from zero and ends with n-1, where n is the total length of the array (which is the number of elements in the array or list).\n",

    "## NumPy Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a library in Python that supports large, multidimensional arrays and matrices. It facilitates scientific computing with high level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy object is a multi-dimensional array. It is a table of elements of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In Numpy, dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is rank. (ref: scipy.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 3D space of x, y and z coordinates. A  point in 3D space [1.0, 3.0, 5.0] is an array of rank 1. If there are several such points as shown below, then the dimensions are 4 and 3.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[ 1.0, 0.3, 4.5],\n",
    " [ 0.5, 1.5, 2.3],\n",
    " [ 6.0, 4.6, 3.5],\n",
    " [ 4.5, 3.5, 6.3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use a library, we need to import them. Any python library can be referenced by an alias that is mentioned during the import. For example, NumPy library is most commonly imported in the short form as np:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to initialize an array in numpy :\n",
    "* a = np.array([0,1,2,3])   ...   creates an array of rank 1\n",
    "* a = np.array([[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]])   ...   creates a 2x4 matrix  \n",
    "* a = np.ones((3,3))   ...   creates a 3x3 matrix with all 1s\n",
    "* a = np.zeroes((2,2))   ...   creates a 2x2 matrix with all 0s\n",
    "* a = np.eye(3)   ...   creates a 3x3 matrix with 1s at the diagonal and 0s otherwise\n",
