    "In a previous notebook, we looked at using graphical methods for normality testing. We also learned how to compare data from other distributions to a normal distribution. While graphical tests are one approach to test for normality in data, another approach is to use statistical tests to check for normality. Statistical tests provide a quantitative picture compared to graphical tests. However, factors like the sample size and large deviations in the data set can yield the wrong results. Hence, care must be taken while interpreting statistical tests. \n",

We pick these tests based on their statistical power. Statistical power is defined as the probability that a test will make a type 2 error. The higher the probability that it will make type 2 errors, the less power the test has. In our selection, the Shapiro-Wilk test has the highest power, followed by the Anderson Darling and Lilliefors test.\n",
