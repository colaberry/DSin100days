    "Classification refers to associating a target variable uniquely into one of the known classes. When number of classes are more than 2, then it is called multiclass classification. When the number of classes are two, then it is called binary classification. Logistic Regression is one of the popular type of classification techniques used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following type of scenario where the output y, varies with x as shown in the figure below where linear regression is used for fitting the model. \n",

    "As you can see above the line does not pass through the data points. If they were to pass through the data points and 'fit' the data approximately well, then a Linear Regression model would be useful. Also, there are a good number of overlaps of 0s and 1s for the same value of X. This means that for a given age, it is difficult to tell if the person aboard the Titanic survived or dead easily with the above graph. This problem can be clearly identified as a classification problem as the output is a finite number, either a 0 or a 1. This is also an example of how Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be useful by plotting the output variable, 'Survived' against one of the independent variables, 'Age'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot use a linear regression to model a binary response, because the predicted values of $y$ will not be limited to 0 or 1. Instead of $y$, we could model probability of $y$, but even then, the predicted values cannot be limited to values between 0 and 1. Also, the relationship is not linear, but sigmoidal or S-shaped. In such cases, a function of the probability is used. The most frequently used is the logit function which is the natural log of the odds of success. The logistic regression model is expressed as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Ln \\big(\\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)}\\big) = \\beta_0 + \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n}X_i\\beta_i \\quad$ where $p(y)$ is the probability of success.\n",

    "### Competition Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall use this dataset for analysis and study of logistic regression. \n",

    "### Loading the Data\n",

    "The data has been split into train_data, test_data and can be loaded from kaggle with read_csv command:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us perform EDA on the dataset to understand it better, prior to fitting the logistic regression model. Let us use distplot in seaborn to generate the distribution plot of those who survived and those who didn't:\n",

    "sns.distplot(train_data['Survived'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "<img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/rfjh/media/CKEditorImages/2016/12/11/logistic-dist-2.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above distribution, it can be observed that those who survived are approximately 2/3rd in the training set.We can observe that there were children and mostly adults followed by lesser aged people with max of 80 years approximately. This can be observed by two peaks in the fitted distribution.\n",
