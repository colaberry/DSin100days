    "TensorFlow provides three ways to code up neural networks. The first is a graph mode where you can define and carry out calculations on a computational graph.

The third mode is the subject of this notebook called the Keras API. Keras was a high level prototyping framework for deep learning.

The first layer we are providing is the InputLayer. We provide this layer with information about the input image's shape and a name for the layer. It is a good habit to provide names to each Keras layer since it makes it more intuitive to track layers and identify layers when we are trying to get layer-wise output. \n",

We specific the kernel size which is the size of the convolutional filter.   The \"same\" padding ensures that the output of the convolution layer is a 28 X 28 size feature map which is the size of the original image. You can change the padding to \"valid\" which will reduce the size of the feature map size to 26 X 26. For more information on padding check out the [Keras documentation on convolutional layers](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/). \n",

Flatten takes this matrix and makes it into a  (28 X 28 X 32 ) X 1 vector which is a 25088 X 1 vector. We flatten a convolutional layer so that we can us dense layers to get an output. \n",

    " We have covered some of the basic functionalities of Keras in this notebook. As you can see, Keras is intuitve and easy to use. It is reduces the steep learning curve of other deep learning frameworks and integrates well with TensorFlow. This notebook is by no means a exhaustive exploration of all the tools in Keras but meant to be a starting point to working with it.We will cover many more Keras functionalities as we proceed through the course."
