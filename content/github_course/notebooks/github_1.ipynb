    "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. You will often use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead."

    "Large, fast-changing projects with many authors need a Version Control System to track changes and avoid general chaos. The main functions of a VCS are as follows:\n",
    "- **Backup and Restore.** Files are saved as they are edited, and you can jump to any moment in time. Need that file as it was on Feb 23, 2019? No problem.\n",
    "- **Synchronization.** Lets people share files and stay up-to-date with the latest version.\n",
    "- **Short-term undo.** Monkeying with a file and messed it up? Throw away your changes and go back to the “last known good” version in the database.\n",
    "- **Long-term undo.** Sometimes we mess up bad. Suppose you made a change a year ago, and it had a bug. Jump back to the old version, and see what change was made that day.\n",
    "- **Track Changes.** As files are updated, you can leave messages explaining why the change happened (stored in the VCS, not the file). This makes it easy to see how a file is evolving over time, and why.\n",
    "- **Track Ownership.** A VCS tags every change with the name of the person who made it. Helpful for giving credit and maintaining responsibility.\n",
    "- **Sandboxing,** or insurance against yourself. Making a big change? You can make temporary changes in an isolated area, test and work out the kinks before “checking in” your changes.\n",
    "- **Branching and merging.** A larger sandbox. You can branch a copy of your code into a separate area and modify it in isolation (tracking changes separately). Later, you can merge your work back into the common area."
