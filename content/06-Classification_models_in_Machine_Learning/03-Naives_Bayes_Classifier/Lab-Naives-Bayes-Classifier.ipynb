    "Consider an orchestration server which renders IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) to a host of applications. The applications send a request which consists of the timestamp of request, the number of cores requested and the amount of RAM memory requested. Using this infrastructure requirements, the orchestration spawns a virtual machine with the said configurations for the application to utilize. We have a data set which contains requests data pertaining to all requests sent in the month of January 2019, by 3 major applications - Engineering Computations Program (ECP), Predictive Modeling Services (PMS) and Media Library Query (MLQ). Based on the 3 features mentioned above, we would like to predict which application may have sent the request.\n",
