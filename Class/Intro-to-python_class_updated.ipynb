    "# Intro to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a simple, easy-to-learn, pseudo-code resembling programming language. It is rich with all the features of any object oriented language. Scientists and Mathematicians have been using python since its inception and hence is popular for analytical tasks. Python is also known for its brevity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Python - the origins </li>\n",
    "<li>Features of Python language</li>\n",
    "<li>Why is Python a Favorite of Data Scientists </li>\n",
    "<li>Python Standard Library </li>\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "## Python - the origins \n",
    "\n",
    "Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum in the year 1989, as a pet project. It was first released to the public in the year 1991. Initially python was written as \"a scripting language with a syntax like ABC language but with access to the Amoeba distributed operating system calls developed at CWI, Netherlands (https://www.cwi.nl/about)\", as mentioned by the author of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read this link for detailed write-up regarding the need for creating Python - https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place\n",
    "\n",
    "From the language users' perspective, the Python programming language was considered a gap-filler, a way to write automated scripts to do mundane jobs such as copying files over. Later over the years it has been used in various scenarios from automated testing, DevOps to deploy applications, rapid application prototyping,  Web app development using Frameworks such as Django, and to do scientific research programming.\n",
    "Eventually Python has become the language of choice for Data Science and Machine Learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was made possible due to the fact that the language is extensible via modules and libraries. Various libraries have been developed and added to Python world over the years in areas as wide ranging as WebApp Frameworks to Statistics and Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of the Python language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy language to learn and use. The language is designed in such a way that it is easy to write code, even when you are starting to learn it. Similarly it is easy read python code written by others and understand it. For example consider the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code is intuitive and does exactly what it reads like. That is, it prints the text \"Hello World\".\n",
    "Intdentation is built-in feature of python language. This makes it easy to read the code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sayHello():\n",
    "    print('Hello world')\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code snippet, the function definition line is followed by a statement, print in ths case, whci is indented. This indicates that the statement is part of the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Well Supported and Widely Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been hugely popular and widely used for several types of applications. Python is available on all major Operating Systems and platforms. Many libraries are available in python including Statistics, Machine Learning libraries etc. Python has wrappers for various APIs and native components using C. Python is a versatile language. \n",
    "\n",
    "### General Application Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to create both command-line, Web Apps and cross-platform GUI applications. There are GUI modules such as TkInter to develop GUI apps. You can deploy them as self-contained executables using packages such as cx_Freeze and PyInstaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Application Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to for developing enterprise web applications using Web App frames such as Flask and Django. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Persistence and Data Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in support for Data Persistence with suport for SQLite library. It has support for JSON handling (https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html), XML parsing using DOM and SAX parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional help with SQLite3 Data library in python, refer to the link: https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html \n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Implementation\n",
    "A great leverage for Python over other programming languages is that it can be implemented in Object-Oriented (OO) manner. In later section of this course we will be using Python objects. OO really means creating a class and managing that class with a set of methods that will be defined later in the class. Classes can contain a set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>self</b>: <br>\n",
    "This is a keyword that python uses to instantiate a class for a particular object. In the example below we see \n",
    "<u><i>self</i></u> being used in the constructor which is created by <b>\\_\\_init\\_\\_()</b>. The code is explaining to the python \n",
    "compiler that in this class, we have constructor for the class obj1 and has certain parameters and it also contains\n",
    "a method for the class for further manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Classic way of instantiating a Python class\n",
    "class obj1():\n",
    "    # Constructor: It is required to manage the parameters we want to manipulate, in this case param1 and param2 \n",
    "    def __init__(self, param1, param2):\n",
    "        self.param1 = param1\n",
    "        self.param2 = param2\n",
    "    # Method: when called in the code the processor runs the snippet of code defined in this method.          \n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        print(self.param1)\n",
    "obj_example = obj1('param1', 'param2')\n",
    "# Methods are accessed in python through '.' notation.\n",
    "obj_example.method1()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamically Typed\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed (or duck typed), meaning the data types need not be specified unlike the static typed languages such as C or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "For programmers from java or C background, there is a separate version of python called mypy that allows static typing. This provides a way for using python with static typing if your code deserves it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to mypy http://mypy-lang.org/examples.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Python a Favorite of Data Scientists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is interactive and has a lot of flexibility such as not necessitating declaration of complex types of variables. This helps Data Scientists easily translate their ideas into experiments. Python offers extensive libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn. Any area of Data Science will most likely have libraries in python available. We shall therefore be using Python throughout the course.Before getting in python libraries,we will explain fundamental concepts in python such as variables and object-orientation programming which are major parts of machine learning/AI engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard library contains a variety of components such as data types, built-in functions and exceptions, and a collection of modules. Some modules are written in C and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and imported in source form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the categories and built-in libraries are included below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Functions\n",
    " \n",
    " Some of the typical built-in functions are :\n",
    " <li>print() - for printing to system output</li>\n",
    " <li>str() -  to convert an object to a printable string</li>\n",
    " <li>int() - to return an integer object from a number or string (with digits only)</li>\n",
    " <li>file() - Constructor for file object representing a file.</li>\n",
    " <li>open() - to open a file for reading, writing or appending.</li>\n",
    " etc.\n",
    " \n",
    " For an exhaustive list of built-in functions please refer to this link : https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#built-in-funcs\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Built-in Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The python language contains several built-in types. The principal built-in types are <b>numerics, sequences, mappings, files, classes, instances</b> and <b>exceptions.</b> This includes the data types and several other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four distinct numeric types: <b>plain integers, long integers, floating point numbers,</b> and <b>complex numbers.</b> In addition, Booleans are a subtype of plain integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are seven sequence types: <b>strings, Unicode strings, lists, tuples, bytearrays, buffers,</b> and <b>xrange objects.</b> For example, String literals are sequences which are written in single or double quotes: 'xyzzy', \"frobozz\". Unicode strings are much like strings, but are specified in the syntax using a preceding 'u' character: u'abc', u\"def\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also <b>dict</b>, which is a Map Type and <b>set</b> which is part of Set types within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Callable Types are types which can be invoked from python statements - such as <b>User-defined functions, User-defined (class) Methods, Class Types</b> and <b>Class Instances</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details refer to this link : https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### String operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Library provides some string operations using string module such as lowercase(), uppercase() to convert string to lower case or upper case respectively. In addition it has several functions such as format() for string formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 're' module provides regular expressions for advanced string searching and handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed explanation of strings and operations is provided in subsequent lessons later in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other packages in standard library pertains to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Data Type operations</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Numerical & Mathematical operations </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> File Access operations </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed explanations of each component of standard library, see this link: https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html#library-index \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to install additional libraries?\n",
    "As you progress in your career you would usually require more tools than that are provided in the standard library. \n",
    "In that case we would need to install these libraries. For that the simplest way is the 'pip install' command. <br>\n",
    "Performance Improvement Plan (pip) acts as a package manager and if the anaconda installation is successful then pip can be used to add aditional libraries of your choice. The command is a terminal commands and hence should be run on the terminal/command line prompt <br>\n",
    "Command: 'pip install (name of package)'<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance: \n",
    "<li>pip install keras</li>\n",
    "<li>pip install numpy</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python installation check\n",
    "In order to confirm our installation of Python in our OS, we will use the terminal/command Prompt\n",
    "We would open the terminal and type the command<br> 'Python --version'\n",
    "Command![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3 vs Python 2\n",
    "There are many differences between Python 3 and Python 2, we would be looking some mild difference in this section so that Data Scientists can get an idea how to practice analysis regardless of the version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Print Statements\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# only in V 2\n",
    "print 'Data Science'\n",
    "\n",
    "# V 2 and V 3\n",
    "print('Data Science')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to establish a connection between the 2 versions, for instance, if you have V2 but need to work with V3 synthax for work practices or other reasons, you can simply use it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# V2\n",
    "from __future__ import print_function\n",
    "print('Data Science')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Popular example would be division.<br>In V2, by default each division between 2 ints will be rounded to the nearest number\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# In V2\n",
    "# Ans = 2\n",
    "print 5/2\n",
    "```\n",
    "But in V3\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# In V3\n",
    "# Ans = 2.5\n",
    "print(5/2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans = 2\n",
    "print(5//2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For V2 users if you need to have a V3 programming practice<br>\n",
    "simply use it in this manner\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "from __future__ import division\n",
    "# Ans = 2.5\n",
    "print(5/2)\n",
    "# Ans = 2\n",
    "print(5//2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you were to use it with the 'from __future__ import division' then both pieces of code would print 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python 3?\n",
    "Python 2 has been in use for a long time and many legacy systems had been using the language for their development.<br> \n",
    "Post the introduction of Python 3, V2 is being deprecated. Python 3 has garnered a lot of popularity because it has been adopted\n",
    "by many programmers who are developing software in V3 which may not be usable in the previous versions. \n",
    "Many companies are also enroute to converting their legacy code which was in V2 to V3. \n",
    "For this course it is suggested that students use V3 instead of V2 as the Refactored Platform is built in V3"
