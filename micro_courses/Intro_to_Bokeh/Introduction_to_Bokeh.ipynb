    "## Bar Graph\n",
    "Suppose we have three labels in an iris dataset, \"setosa\", \"versicolor\", and \"virginica\". The counts for each category are [50, 20, 10]. To plot these as vertical bars, we can do the following-\n",

    "show(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can see that there are several differences from the previous code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We choose to only keep 2 tools, hover and pan and get rid of the other tools.<br>\n",
    "2) We have this new option 'toolbar_location', this just decides where you can place the tool bar. <br>\n",
    "3) The argument 'x_range' let us set the names of the ticks on the x axis, since we have 3 ticks, we have 3 names.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between plotting a scatter plot or a line plot or a bar plot comes in the next line where we generate a figure of type 'vbar' which stands for vertical bar. Here you need to specify the x axis label for each category is 'x' and the counts for each of the categories which are given by 'top=[50,20,10]'. This array specifies the different values for each bar. The argument 'bottom' tells us what is the starting values for the bar. Currently it's set to 0. Suppose we wanted to plot the bar from 10 to 50 units, we can do that by specifying the argument 'bottom' as 10 and 'top' as 50. We can also specify the width of each bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### horizontal bar \n",
    "Suppose you want to take the data from the previous exercise and plot it as a **horizontal bar** rather than vertical bar. You would then do- \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p = figure( y_range= [\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\"], plot_height=250, title=\"Iris plant type counts\",\n",

    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "the plot would look like-\n",
    "<img src='images/hiris.jpg' style='width:70vw'>\n",
    "\n",
    "there are a few differences in the code compared to the code of the vertical bar plot. First being, rather than 'x_range' we have 'y_range' this is because if we are plotting horizontal plots our labels will be on the y-axis. In other words, the axis where we are going to place our categories is the y-axis. The rest of 'figure' definition does not change. The method to add a horizontal bar is 'hbar', similar to 'vbar'. It takes an axis argument 'y', which should contain the names of the categories that we want to plot. We also have the argument 'height', which controls the thickness of the horizontal bars. This is the same as the argument 'width' for vertical bars. I have plotted this as a list to show that you can control the height of each bar. Similarly, you can also do 'width = [1, 0.2, 0.6]', which represents different vertical bars' thicknesses. Like vertical bar, we can specify the location of the horizontal bar, in this case,  as 'left' and 'right'. So, if we want to specify a horizontal bar from location 10 to 30 we would write- 'left=10' and 'right=30'. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, of which we can specify the bars in bokeh allows for a great degree of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding legends to plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the type of chart, we want to be able to add legends to a chart that shows the different fields of data which we are looking at. We held of doing this from earlier since it's easier to illustrate with bar charts. Suppose you have a vertical bar chart of the iris dataset, from the above example you would realize that all three of the categories have the same color. So how can we represent them differently? We can do the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "You will notice a plot with three bars with colors red, green and blue. Now we want to add a legend to this so that we can easily see which category each color belongs to.

    "In this notebook we have learned how to plot and modify simple line, scatter plots and bar charts. The methods we learned around modifying title, axes and adding tools are general tools that apply to all bokeh plots. There are more interactivities that we can add to the Bokeh plots, for example, adding panning to multiple plots, adding sliders, buttons, and controls. These functionalities can bring more customizations to plots. If you want to learn more about Bokeh, check out our course at https://refactored.ai. Our course covers everything from introductory Python to Pandas, Plotly, Bokeh, and to machine learning techniques."
