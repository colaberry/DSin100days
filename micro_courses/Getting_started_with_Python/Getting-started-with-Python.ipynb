    "# Getting started with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for data science related skills are growing rapidly in recent years.  Irrespective of the domain, data science methods have helped leverage the power of data to provide invaluable insights to businesses. This has led to an explosion of data science tools and techniques which has created countless opportunities. However, due to this same reason, starting out in this field can be daunting. If you want to become a data science practitioner but do not have any experience, the question will be: \n",
    "Where do I start? Which skill should I learn first? \n",
    "\n",
    "The best answer is to start with Python. Here is why:<br>\n",
    "Python is a simple, easy-to-learn, general purpose programming language. It is rich with all the features of any object oriented language. Scientists and Mathematicians have been using python since its inception and hence is popular for analytical tasks. Python has quickly become the go to language for data scientists all over the world.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this micro course, we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Features of Python language</li>\n",
    "<li>Why is Python a Favorite of Data Scientists </li>\n",
    "<li>Python Standard Library </li>\n",
    "<br>   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of the Python language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is easy\n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code outputs what it reads. That is, it prints the text \"Hello World\".\n",
    "Indentation is built-in feature of python language. This makes it easy to read the code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sayHello():\n",
    "    print('Hello world')\n",
    "# Then we can call the function to see the result:\n",
    "sayHello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code snippet, the function definition line is followed by a statement, print in the case, which is indented. This indicates that the statement is part of the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple exercise, you can practice in the following code cell.<br>\n",
    "Try to define a function \"hiPython()\", which can print out \"Hi everyone, this is Python\". Then call the function to see the result."

    "There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.\n",

    "When we want to put a placeholder for a variable and pass the value to the function separately, we can use something called **format specifier**. This is typically a set of symbols which tell the function about the format in which the value being passed is to be printed. Format specifiers for various types of data types in Python are similar to other programming languages:\n",

    ">>> 5.  10.2647\n",
    ">>> 6. 010.2647\n",
    ">>> 7. 00010.2647\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Important note:</b> In above example '{:4.4f}' and '{04.4f}' give the same output, where we cannot see any padding (neither blanks nor zeroes). This is because the length that we specified for the string is 4, whereas we have also asked for 4 digits after the decimal point. So the digits after decimal take precedence and these 4 digits are added first.\n",
    "Then the whole number is generated - the characteristic (digits before decimal) and the mantissa (digits after the decimal). After this the control checks to add padding. It now finds that the condition for length of number we have specified is 4, and the length of number is already more than 4, hence it does not add any padding blanks or zeroes.\n",

    "### Well Supported and Widely Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been hugely popular and widely used for several types of applications. Python is available on all major Operating Systems and platforms. Many libraries are available in python including Statistics, Machine Learning libraries etc. Python has wrappers for various APIs and native components using C. Python is a versatile language. \n",
    "\n",
    "### General Application Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to create both command-line, Web Apps and cross-platform GUI applications. There are GUI modules such as TkInter to develop GUI apps. You can deploy them as self-contained executables using packages such as cx_Freeze and PyInstaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Application Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to for developing enterprise web applications using Web App frames such as Flask and Django. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Persistence and Data Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in support for Data Persistence with support for SQLite library. It has support for JSON handling (https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html), XML parsing using DOM and SAX parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional help with SQLite3 Data library in python, refer to the link: https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html \n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Implementation\n",
    "Python supports object oriented(OO) programming. In later section of this course we will introduce Python objects. OO involves  creating a class and managing that class with a set of methods that will be defined later in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamically Typed\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed (or duck typed), meaning the data types need not be specified unlike the static typed languages such as C or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "For programmers from Java or C background, there is a separate version of python called mypy that allows static typing. This provides a way for using python with static typing.\n",

    "## Why is Python a favorite of Data Scientists?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has gained popularity within the data science community and especially amongst data scientists over the last decade. It allows for quick prototyping of machine learning models with functional support for data manipulation (through packages like Pandas), data visualizations (packages like matplotlib, plotly and bokeh) and model building (scikit learn, scipy etc). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard library contains a variety of components such as data types, built-in functions and exceptions, and a collection of modules. Some modules are written in C and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and imported in source form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the categories and built-in libraries are included below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Functions\n",
    " \n",
    " Some of the typical built-in functions are :<br>\n",
    " print() - for printing to system output<br>\n",
    " str() -  to convert an object to a printable string<br>\n",
    " int() - to return an integer object from a number or string (with digits only)<br>\n",
    " file() - Constructor for file object representing a file.<br>\n",
    " open() - to open a file for reading, writing or appending.<br>\n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Built-in Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The python language contains several built-in types. The principal built-in types are <b>numerics, sequences, mappings, files, classes, instances</b> and <b>exceptions.</b> This includes the data types and several other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four distinct numeric types: <b>plain integers, long integers, floating point numbers,</b> and <b>complex numbers.</b> In addition, Booleans are a subtype of plain integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are seven sequence types: <b>strings, Unicode strings, lists, tuples, bytearrays, buffers,</b> and <b>xrange objects.</b> For example, String literals are sequences which are written in single or double quotes: 'xyzzy', \"frobozz\". Unicode strings are much like strings, but are specified in the syntax using a preceding 'u' character: u'abc', u\"def\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also <b>dict</b>, which is a Map Type and <b>set</b> which is part of Set types within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Callable Types are types which can be invoked from python statements - such as <b>User-defined functions, User-defined (class) Methods, Class Types</b> and <b>Class Instances</b> \n",

    "### String operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Library provides some string operations using string module such as lower(), upper() to convert string to lower case or upper case respectively. In addition it has several functions such as format() for string formatting.<br> \n",
    "The following example shows how string operations are different from numerical operations, as well as converting a lowercase string to uppercase:\n",
