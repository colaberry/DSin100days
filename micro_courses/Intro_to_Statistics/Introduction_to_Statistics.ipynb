    "One of the most important concepts to understand in statistics is the concept of population. \n",
    "\n",
    "A population is typically a collection of information with at least one property being in common. For this lets take a simple example- take for example a dataset of people's weights.  We will call this population P. Let's say P is - <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "A single number in the population P is called an element. In population P, the common property between each element is that each element represents the weight of a person. Without this similarity, it would be difficult for us to make any use of a population, since we have nothing in common between each element of the population.\n",

    "Question: If we consider the iris dataset as a population, what do you think would be the common property of the population? What would you consider as a single element of the population? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The common property within the iris dataset is the flower measurements. Each row of the data has the same features- [sepal length , sepal width , petal length, petal width ]. We can safely assume that each entry in this dataset corresponds to the measurements of a flower. That also answers our section question- unlike the weights dataset, where a single number was the element of the population, here a single row of the dataset is a single element of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined a population, we can start talking about sampling. Let us go back to our population P. We can break our population into smaller group of numbers. This process is called sampling. For example, from P if we pick two elements such that <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "P = [87,343,43,45,24,234,24,25,53,93] <br>\n",
    "Q  = [24, 53]\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical language we would say that Q is a sample of the population P. This is because Q contains a few elements of the population P. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at another example that may help you visualize this. Let us suppose there are 100 balls in a bucket. These 100 balls in the bucket would be the population. Selecting 20 balls from that bucket is the process of sampling from the population, and the collection of 20 balls would be called a sample of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the process of sampling from the population can be done in really two ways- Random sampling and Non-random sampling.  Random sampling is when we pick sample from the population at random. What we did previously in generating Q was an example of random sampling, where we just decided, let us pick two elements from the population and create the sample Q. The point is that there was no bias in picking those numbers. We did not, for example, pick two numbers just because they were next to each other. Nor did we say that we pick the largest number and the smallest number and generate a sample out of them, that would be an example of non-random sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "How would you do Random sampling on a computer? - In case of P we would assign an index to each element of the population and then use a random number generator to generate two random numbers. Pull those values for those indicies and viola, we would have our set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try this with P - For this exercise we will introduce the python package called random. This package, amongst other rather invaluable functions, lets us generate random numbers.\n"

    "Let us read this error carefully. Firstly this is a value error, which means that some number stored with in sample function is wrong, secondly we know that the error is in the sample function since...well python tells us so.  The value error also gives us a suggestion- \"Cannot take a larger sample than population when 'replace=False'\". What is this whole business of setting \"replace = False\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling with and without replacement \n",
    "\n",
    "So as we take  random samples from a population there are two ways that we can do it- <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "<li>With replacement - where we add elements of the same value back into population <\\li>\n",
    "<li>Without replacement-  where once we remove them from the population we do not replace the elements <\\li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "So for example going back to our population P, when we create the sample Q from P, we were doing that with replacement. What we did was we took out two elements from P and put back the same elements, at the same spot, back into P. The second part of that statement is super important. We put the elements back at the same spot. We did NOT change the order of the the elements in the population. This is an essentially trait of the with replacement process. \n",
    " \n",
    "If we do this without replacement, we would end up with something like this - \n",
    "\n",
    "P = [87,343,43,45,234,24,25,93]  Q = [24, 53]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are just 8 elements in P, since we have removed two elements from P and formed the sample Q. Since P is a finite dataset, there are only so many times that we can sample from P. In this case basically about 5 times. Beyond that, we can sample it since P will be empty, i.e it becomes a null set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is a fun question to think about - \n",
    "\n",
    "Question:  What happens if you sample with replacement from an infinite dataset, for example- collection of all real numbers? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: This is where an already definition of with and without replacement comes in. We can say that with replacement essentially lets us choose an element of a population infinite number of times whereas without replacement lets us choose that number only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to keep in mind is that population can themselves be finite or infinite. As we alluded to above, P is an finite population. The collection of all real numbers is an infinite population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Is the collection of all coin tosses a finite or infinite population? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: All coin tosses would be an infinite population since I can keep tossing coins forever. The thing is that I really cannot count how many coins are there and how many times have I tossed them. Now If I fix the number of times I toss a coin and the number of coins I am tossing then its finite, BUT that is a sample of an infinite population which represent all coin tosses. Its a mind bender if you really think about it! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been talking about sampling from a population and samples. The reason we care about samples is because most of the time in real life we can get information about population. For example, if we want to study the problem of obesity in the world, there are only so many people whose weights we can know. We can go to every hospital in the world, collect all the data about patients, even then we would not have the information about everyone. Its just not feasible of to do so. At best we are going to have data of about 80% or 90% of all the people in the world. In the language of statistics, we would essentially have a sample whose size is 80% or 90% the size of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a sample we can do various measurements on the sample. These measurements (or more formally referred to as measures ) are called statistics. For example the mean of sample would be a type of \"statistic\", other examples of measures are-standard deviation, standard error. We will look at some of these in a little while. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we do not always have access to population, the measurements we make on the sample, we say, is representative of the measurements we make on the population. This leads to the idea that sample is representative of the population. Of course, it is our responsibility to ensure that the sample large enough represent the population. A sample size of 1 element would not be a a representation of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to discuss sampling distribution, let us look at a finite population where we randomly sample with replacement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets do this with the iris dataset, suppose we take N samples from the iris dataset, and then take means of each sample. We can plot these means in an distribution, such a distribution is called a sampling distribution. More specifically this would be a sampling distribution of means.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make things easier by just looking at 1 feature (i.e column) of the iris dataset. In the visualization below we can select for which column of the dataset we want the sampling distribution of means. We also have slider that controls the number number of times we are sampling from the population and the sample size as well."

    "Here comes the super important part. See in the above case that we knew what the population was. Many times when you collect data, you do not know what the population mean or the population standard deviation is. Actually this will almost always be the case. If I ask you to find the standard deviation of the age of all children in world, you can't do that. You can however pull samples, calculate a sampling distribution of the mean, take its standard deviation  and then multiply it with $\\sqrt(n)$ where $n$ is your sample size and get that standard deviation. We infer information about the population from the data we have about samples. That is the power of statistics! \n",
