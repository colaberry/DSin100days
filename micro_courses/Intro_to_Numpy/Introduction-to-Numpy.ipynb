    "# Intro to Numpy\n",
    "**NumPy** is a library in Python that supports creation and operations on large, multidimensional arrays and matrices. It facilitates scientific and numeric computing with high level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this micro course we will learn how to use Numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy object is generally a multi-dimensional array. It is a table of elements with **the same data type** (int, float, char, etc.), indexed by a tuple of positive integers (also called *indices*). In Numpy, dimensions are called *axes*. The number of axes is *rank*. (ref: [scipy.org](https://scipy.org))\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 3D space of x, y and z coordinates. A  point in 3D space is written as\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1.0, 3.0, 5.0] \n",
    "```\n",
    "and is an array of rank 1. If there are several such points as shown below, then the dimensions are of the nature *m by n*. In the example shown below, there are 4 rows and 3 columns (i.e., 3 elements or values for each point/observation), this translates to an n-dimensional array with a shape of 4 by 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[ 1.0, 0.3, 4.5],\n",
    " [ 0.5, 1.5, 2.3],\n",
    " [ 6.0, 4.6, 3.5],\n",
    " [ 4.5, 3.5, 6.3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "We need to import the numpy library to use it. Any python library can be referenced by an alias that is mentioned during the import. For example, NumPy library is most commonly imported in the short form as np:\n",

    "# Importing the numpy library\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to initialize an array in numpy :\n",

    "* a = np.array([[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]])   ...   creates a 2x4 matrix  \n",
    "* a = np.ones((3,3))   ...   creates a 3x3 matrix with all 1s\n",

    "## 2. Casting a non-array datatype into an array\n",
    "\n",
    "The np.array() method can be used to convert a variable of any data type into an n-dimensional array. By simply passing the variable as an argument to this function, we can convert the variable which can be an integer, float, list, series or dataframe into an n-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "type(a)\n",
    ">>> int\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array(a)\n",
    "type(a)\n",
    ">>> numpy.ndarray\n",
    "\n",
    "b = [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]\n",
    "type(b)\n",
    ">>> list\n",
    "\n",
    "b = np.array(b)\n",
    "type(b)\n",
    ">>> numpy.ndarray\n",
    "```\n",

The np.array() method worked anyway and converted the list into an array. The method acheives this by converting all the list elements into string data types. Another interesting behavior to note is that once the elements are cast as a string data types, they cannot be individually re-cast into integer, float or other data types.
