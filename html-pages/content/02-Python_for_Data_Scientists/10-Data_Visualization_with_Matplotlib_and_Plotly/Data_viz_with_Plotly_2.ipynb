    "# Interactive Visualization with Plotly - 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced plots\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second lesson in plotly visualization where we will learn some advanced visualization in plotly. These visualizations are basically specialized plots which convey rich statistical observations rather than simply representing data on a graph. Hence these plots are being termed as advanced plots within this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are the most common and basic plots used to showcase the distribution of a dataset/feature. The premise for construction of a histogram is a frequency chart.\n",
    "* Lets say you have 100 observations in the range of A to B.\n",
    "* The range A to B is divided into buckets each of equal size, if the range between A and B is divided into 'n' equally sized buckets (or intervals, as they are statistically referred to), then we say that the range A to B has \"n classes\".\n",
    "* Observations belonging to each interval are counted. Total observations in a given interval/bucket determine its frequency count.\n",
    "* Intervals are plotted on the x-axis and the frequency is plotted on the y-axis. Each interval has a bar, the length of which is determined by the frequency count.\n",
    "* The bars do not have any gap between them, thus denoting a continues range being broken into intervals. This is a distinction between histogram and bar chart, where bars in bar chart have a gap between them denoting that each bar is a separate category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram chart is pretty easy to construct. The data series/feature can be used to construct a 'Histogram' object from the graph objects module. The data object can then be used in the iplot function to visualize the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is sample code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Importing libraries\n",
    "import plotly.offline as ofl\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objs as go\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating data\n",
    "x = np.random.randn(500)\n",
    "data = [go.Histogram(x=x)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visualizing plot\n",
    "ofl.iplot(data, filename='basic histogram')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a histogram for the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Data History:</u>\n",
    "* A large lighting company has recently created a new LED light which is pending a patent.\n",
    "* In order to test the design, the company has manufactured a batch of 1000 samples and has recorded various metrics for each bulb - lumen intensity, color temperature, energy consumption etc.\n",
    "* The data dictionary is as given below:\n",
    "    1. <i>Tester_ID</i> - This is the unique id assigned to each test unit/bulb.\n",
    "    2. <i>lumen_intensity</i> - This is the average intensity of light emitted by the test unit over the period of testing. It is measured in lumens.\n",
    "    3. <i>color_temperature</i> - This is the color of the light emitted by the test unit. It is measured in degrees Kelvin.\n",
    "    4. <i>energy_consumption</i> - This is the amount of energy consumed by the test unit. It is measured in Watts.\n",
    "    5. <i>component_temperature</i> - This is the temperature of surrounding components that dissipate energy in the form of heat. It is measure in degrees Celsius.\n",
    "    6. <i>time_to_failure</i> - This is the estimated lifespan of the test unit. This is measure in years and is calculated using a function dependent upon many variables, including but not limited to - lumen_intensity, energy_consumption, component_temperature etc.\n",
    "* In this example we will use the \"energy_consumption\" metric for a histogram visualization.\n",
    "* Refer to above example code for construction of the histogram."

    "### Box plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots or Box and whisker plots are one of the most common plots to show distribution of a data set/feature. As its name suggests, it has a box and whiskers. The length of the total box and whisker depict the range of the dataset. The length of the box and the whiskers is determined by the spread of data. The whiskers showcase the top and bottom 25th percentiles of data, whereas the box depicts the middle half, i.e., 25th to 75th percentile of the data. The longer the box/whisker, the more spread out the data would be. There is a line within the box, which depicts the 50th percentile mark of the data. This mark denotes the 'median', one of the measures of central tendency which you will learn later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a box plot, we need to create a trace using the 'box' object from the graph objects library. It works similar to most plotly graph object creations. Refer to the example code given by the plotly documentation below:\n",

    "\n",
    "A heatmap is a cross-table like grid, where each cell of the grid corresponds to an x,y and z value, i.e., each value can represent a 3-dimensional data point. The x value will be on x-axis, y on y-axis and the z value is generally represented by a color. The x and y values determine the position on the grid, i.e., an observation with x,y values as (2,3) would be a cell on the second row and third column of the grid. The z-value, represented visually with wavelength of the color, varies from blue to red, similar to cool and hot temperatures, hence the name heatmap. These colors can be changed to suit needs. The varying intensity of color shows varying intensity of the z-feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> The x and y values on the heatmap are generally discrete or categorical in nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a heatmap we should create a trace using the 'Heatmap' method from graph objects module. The z values should be supplied as a 2-dimensional matrix of values. The index of each value of the 2D matrix determines which x,y position in the grid that specific observation would be placed. We may also set x and y labels, by passing 1D arrays.\n",
