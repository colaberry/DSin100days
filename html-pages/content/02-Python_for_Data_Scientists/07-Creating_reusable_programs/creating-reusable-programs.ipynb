    "# Reusable Python Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "A python program can get quite lengthy and unmanageable, if there are many tasks to be accomplished within that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you will learn how to create python code that could be reused in parts and manageable. \n",
    "You could create functions, modules and libraries that could be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions And Modules Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen that, using functions you could re-use a particular set of statements, that performs a specific task or set of tasks, many times over. like the example below. \n",
    "```\n",
    "def add_values(x, y):\n",
    "  z = x + y\n",
    "  return z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you would encounter a situation where you have to split the program into multiple files for manageablity. These are solved by importing modules, such as in example below: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(25))\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Going further from the modules, as the number of modules grow, you may need to package a set of related (or unrelated) modules together for the users of the modules. This could be done as part of a python library. A library is a collection of modules that could be made available for any user written python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "You import a module or set of modules from a library. You must explicity specify 'from' keyword to specify the library name and then use the 'import ' keyword to specify the module name at the beginning of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to import K-nearest neighbors module \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from sklearn import neighbors\n",

    "## Creating a Python Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a module is just like writing any other Python file. Modules can contain definitions of functions, classes, and variables that can then be utilized in other Python programs. Each module is written in its own .py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by creating a file hello.py that we’ll later import into another file. We will create a function that prints Hello, World!:\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the below code snippet as : <i>hello.py</i>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a function\n",
    "def world():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can import the module we just created using the import statement, and then call the function. This file needs to be in the same directory so that Python knows where to find the module since it’s not a built-in module.\n",
    "Because we are importing a module, we need to call the function by referencing the module name in dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import hello module\n",
    "import hello\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call function\n",
    "hello.world()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could instead import the module as from hello import world and call the function directly as world().\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import using from \n",
    "from hello import world\n",
    "\n",
    "world()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us create a class within hello,py module. A module can also contain a class, as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a class\n",
    "class Greeting:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello \" + self.name + \"!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invoking class from imported module\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now invoke the Greeting class after importing the hello module. See the below example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Import hello module\n",
    "import hello\n",
